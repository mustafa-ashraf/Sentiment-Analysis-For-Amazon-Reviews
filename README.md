Our problem that we have many and many textual review on amazon product but its is complex to employ someone to read this review to extract the overall feedback so we use the power of artificial intelligence to solve this problem.

# Steps
- Scrap reviews about any product on amazon
- perform some preprocessing and cleaning the the text.
- using SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to preform Sentiment Analysis on review.
- visualize the result as bar plot.

# Thank You
