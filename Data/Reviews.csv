0,Lizz,"Appearance: Looks great and is lightweight. The band has a very large size range. If you like silicone bands its nice, very smooth and flexible. I got the color gray and it has already started picking up color staining from my jeans. I would think the other light band colors would do the same so if this is a problem for you go with a dark color. I personally don't care because I'm getting a chainlink band.  Screen: The screen is great!! Easy to see in the sun light even when on the dim setting. This was something I hated about my Fitbit Charge3, the screen was invisible in the sun. It has crisp and clear images, text is very easy to read. Responsive to touch and actuate to where you touch.  Battery life: Fantastic! I use the dim setting and it lasts about 10 days. Also charges pretty quickly.  Fitness tracking: Okay, this is the biggest problem for me personally. Most of my outdoor exercise is walking/jogging while pushing my toddler in the stroller. It will not track steps or distance when I am holding the handle bar. If you are doing regular running, hiking, ect it works fine; but I do wonder how it would do tracking cycling as your hands are put in a similar position holding the handle bars. A positive that I got even with it struggling to track my movment, it still monitors heart rate and shows what workout zone you are it for calories/fat burning and I do like that.  HR/step/sleep tracking: day to day use works perfectly fine and I found it as accurate at my old Fitbit Charge3. The sleep tracking is a little off and hard to understand on the app, so be warned if that matters to you.  App: Easy to set up, very basic, and does its job. No issues with it but not overly impressed. Its fine.  Other features: My 2 favorite things are the weekly totals screen and find my phone. Love how easy to access the weekly total screen is, and the find my phone ability it great. It uses the volume for your phones media setting not the ringtone, so even if your phone is on vibrate it will still make noise if the media volume is on. Very handy! More watch faces would be nice, it lacks a good analog face and the digital faces do not track seconds; however there are some very pretty ones. Relax feature for breathing is basic and fine.  Overall: Worth the money and do recommend it as a good alternative to the big name brands. Other than the problem with tracking my walks/jogs while pushing the stroller I'm very pleased (and again if you're doing other activities it does track those much better). I knew there would be flaws going in because it is cheaper, but for me the few flaws it has are worth dealing with for the price. Deffenitly intend to keep using till it dies! 68 people found this helpful"
1,Kailua Sam,"I had an identical watch from ""Yamay"" which no longer is on Amazon. Might be same company, I dunno. I was looking for a simple inexpensive watch that provided the following features: 1. Water proof, at least in shower, washing dishes, surfing small to mid-sized waves 2. At least 10 alarm settings to wake me up without waking up my wife 3. Big letters 4. Step counter but not actually very important to me. Ball park counting is good enough 5. Simple to navigate 6. Sleeping info  This watch does all of the above. Not really sure about the steps as I haven't paid attention to it. I assume it is same as my Yamay watch and is not very accurate but provides a ball park. FYI, if my hands are on a shopping cart I'm pushing, no steps are counted.  My main features are met and price is low. Easy to install the software, downloaded from Google Play but had to uninstall previous installation for my Yamay. FYI, the Yamay lasted about 3 years. Not great, not bad. I guess good for the price/features.  I would buy it again. 13 people found this helpful"
2,mathman419,"I purchased originally in July 2022, and I was very pleased with the quality and look of the product. It was a rare instance where the quality exceeded the cost. Two months later, my screen suddenly went dark. The tracker itself continued to work as I was able to see metrics via the app. Customer service was great and they replaced the tracker with very minimal effort (I just took a video of me plugging in the tracker and showed the screen not lighting up). Upon receiving, FitPolo sent me a new tracker immediately. One person found this helpful"
3,AZN8TV,"I ordered this as a step tracker. What I got was so much more.  I love the big, bright display. It tells me what time, day and day of the week. As a retired person, I need that sometimes.  The app download was pretty easy, yet I'm not sure I will use it much. I don't care to have my information shared or like to compete with others in step count. Personal preference.  This watch/step counter would be great for any older person who needs a little help by way of a simple watch.  As far as the battery goes, I only wear it during the day. I take it off when I go to bed. The temptation to check the time would interfere with my 8 hours of sleep. The battery has lasted WELL. I got in on Friday, charged it, then started wearing it on Saturday morning. So far, I've only used 10% of the battery.  Love this product! 6 people found this helpful"
4,Jeff Brown Jr.,"I've had this model/brand of watch before. After long years of daily wear and tear, the strap finally broke. (My job is very hands on) To this day my old one still works and still charges well, just no wrist strap anymore. This brand of smart watch is really good for the price you pay. I personally don't use some of the functions, like the email and sleep app, but if you want a nice smart watch, and don't want to pay an outrageous price, this is the one you want.

5,T-Man,"This is a cheap fitness tracker and does what I need it to do. The features on this are limited so don't expect it, as some review claim, to be comparable or better than a name brand smart watch. The step tracker is accurate, I tested it several times by taking 100 steps and it counted them all within a +-10steps. I do like that it can track my walking, running, and gym workouts. While it tracks in ""sport"" mode it also constantly measures your heart rate so you can keep a pace that's suitable to what you want to do (i.e keep a bpm to burn fat). The app for this watch is ok, it syncs with Google Fit, but to use the app you have to keep Bluetooth and location turned on at all times. One work around for me: I sync the watch with the app once a day at night rather than having it sync all day and drain my phone battery. Sleep tracking requires that you wear the watch to sleep...no thanks, I don't use that feature. If you're ok with sleeping with the watch on go for it, let me know how it works out for you. The face can't be changed, a couple of different options are available but the default is probably the best one. The control knob sticks out quite a bit. When I workout at the gym and put on weightlifting gloves they tend to press the control knob of the watch and stop the exercise tracker even if I switched the wrist I wear the watch on(left for now) I believe the knob would still get pressed on accident. Battery life is solid it can go 3-4 days with workout tracking not needing to be charged. After 15% battery life it will not track your workout and will need to be charged. If you're looking to track your daily workout, step count, and stay in shape this is an ideal starter fitness tracker watch. It's durable enough to wear in a gym and weightlift with, sweat doesn't impede it's functions. Go for it give this watch a try it's a great deal at the current price point. 9 people found this helpful"
6,Emily.,"I’ve had a super cheap one (like $20 ones) and it was horrid. So I got this one, works better than the super cheap one. Definitely doesn’t have very many functions like a Fitbit or Apple Watch. The sleep tracker seems to be a bit off. I noticed if I fall asleep, wake up and am up for a while and go back to sleep, it only tracks the second time. It doesn’t track my naps either. Other than that, I don’t really have any complaints. It tracks my steps perfectly, my heart rate. and I can get the important notifications (texts, calls, messenger) on it. 5 people found this helpful"
7,Sarai,"So far, I think this is a good product for it’s price. It tracks every step, heart rate, workouts etc. However, one workout that it does not include is swimming. You get notifications of txts messages, social media and incoming calls. You can only receive these notifications but cannot respond through the fitbit. You can however hang up the incoming calls but can’t answer it from the watch. Overall, it’s a great product for it’s price. 3 people found this helpful"
8,Christopher Jason Cuppett,"I used to own a Samsung Galaxy Gear Frontier smartwatch that allowed me to exercise without my phone. I would go for a run with just my watch, start and stop the exercise activity with just my watch, and it would record everything. Later when I was back from my run I would sync my watch with my phone's Strava app and it would show me all the details of my exercise, including my route location because the watch had GPS built-in.  Unfortunately the battery on the watch died after about three years. Since the Samsung Galaxy Gear was very expensive and had a bunch of features that I did not use, I decided to look around for a cheaper smartwatch that could give me the few features that I wanted: step counter, heart rate monitor, sleep tracker, and exercise route location tracker that would sync with the Strava app.  While I was looking for a new watch, the only way I could get step counting, run distance, and route tracking during my exercises was to run with my phone. This was awkward because my phone is heavy and would bounce around in my pocket while I ran. If I strapped my phone into an armband then it was still awkward because it was difficult to pull the phone out of the armband to stop my exercise recording.  My situation and wanted requirements led me to this FitPolo smartwatch. Based on the product description it had everything I wanted. Once I got it and finished setting it up, I was eager to finally go for a run with just my watch and leave my phone behind at my house. Yet when I got back from my run and synced my watch with the VeryFitPro app, I immediately ran into two problems: it did not show my route location on the VeryFitPro app, and I could not get the app to sync with Strava.  Let me first describe the Strava sync issue. The VeryFitPro does appear to have a link for syncing with Strava. You go to User --> Third party program --> Strava. After you tap that it takes you to a privacy disclaimer where you get two options: ""I agree"" and ""Disagree"". If you tap on ""I agree"", nothing happens for about three seconds, but then the screen goes blank white and takes you back to the Third party program menu. If you tap on Strava again you see the same disclaimer! It never actually sets up the sync with the Strava app. You can keep trying to tap on ""I agree"" and it will never work. I must have tapped on it a dozen times just to make sure it wasn't a temporary glitch. I even restarted the watch and my phone and it still would never sync with Strava.  Regarding the route location tracking issue, the VeryFitPro app would show me all the statistics of my run but the map would be empty. By empty I mean it would show a map of the world, but the map would be centered on west Africa. If I manually moved the map with my fingers to my location near Dallas, Texas, USA then it would not show any route lines, even if I zoomed into where I ran. I later came back to the product description and read that Q&A about the GPS feature. The manufacturer claims that in order to get the GPS tracking to work you need to start the exercise on the VeryFitPro app. So that's when I realized that the watch doesn't have GPS at all, it simply links to the phone app and uses the GPS feature on the phone to work. I consider that very misleading. I know that my phone has GPS. I want a watch that has built-in GPS so I don't have to run with my phone!  For the reasons listed above I decided to return the two FitPolo watches that I purchased because they did not meet my needs (one of the watches was for my daughter). There were some good things about the watch that I feel I should mention as part of this review. The heart rate monitor worked well. You could get your current and historical heart rates with both the watch and the VeryFitPro app on the phone. I slept once with the watch and it appeared to give accurate sleep statistics in the morning. The step counter appeared to work well. It had some nice features like ""find my phone"" that would ring your phone from your watch if you misplaced it somewhere. The watch could be configured through the VeryFitPro app to show notifications from your phone like calendar reminders and new texts. Also, I suppose if you were to strap your phone into an armband you could possibly get route location tracking while still being able to start and stop your exercise on the watch. I did not test this though because I don't want to have to run with my phone at all. 4 people found this helpful"

21,marva knight,Thus watch I've purchased I think 3 times. First 2 times the band kept breaking because I'd get it caught on something. The first time I purchased...returned and received a replacement. 2nd watch broke too but I just put super glue on it and kept it because I liked the functionality of the watch. Well I decided to purchase again and I am so pleased with this watch. The watch gets caught often because I'm clumsy but now with the metal pin it fixable. But I don't agree with the sleep tracker...I would definitely recommend this watch  3 people found this helpful

27,E,"I purchased this watch with extremely low expectations given the price. Whether or not it's for you depends on what you're looking for in a health tracker. I was looking for a simple device that's more advanced than a basic step counter and with more features than the health app that's built into my iPhone. I had no interest in an elaborate device with a wide range of features I'd never use or need. I've always used my iPhone to monitor my steps, walking distance, and sleep. However, I don't always carry my phone and its sleep tracker is rarely accurate and stops with any phone use before getting out of bed. So, I wanted something I could wear to improve step and sleep accuracy. Specifically, I wanted a tracker that included: step count, calories burned, fitness monitor (walking, biking, hiking), sedentary alert, sleep monitor, women's health tracking, timer, and stop watch. I also wanted a BP monitor, but settled on the Fitpolo after days of research as it had everything I wanted except this feature.  Likes: -Battery life is outstanding. I started using it out of the box (it was already charged to 97%) and after wearing it for 14 days straight it is now at 15%. -Sedentary alert. This is my favorite feature and was among the top priorities for me in a health tracker. You can specify the alert intervals as well as start and end time during the day. -On the rare occasion the sleep monitor works, it records the amount of deep sleep and light sleep. -Though I wasn't interested in tracking heart rate, it's accurate (0-4 bpm difference when I compare the number to other heart rate measurements or I count my pulse). -The fitness tracker works properly. -The women's health monitor works properly. -The music controller functions properly. -The device is simple, user-friendly, and easy to read. -I had no issues syncing the Fitpolo with my iPhone and syncing its data with my phone's health app.  Dislikes: -Unlike other fitness tracking apps, the Fitpolo timer keeps going if you stop during your activity. You have to manually pause or stop the activity. This is a minor inconvenience for me. -I realize you get what you pay for, but the app is terrible. It's a cheap product so I knew to expect a cheap app (quality, value, user experience). On the bright side, it works, it's easy to use, and tracks all data. The app (along with the sleep monitor) is the primary reason for my low overall rating. Also, the app doesn't sync automatically. I have to frequently refresh it manually to update or view the data. -The sleep monitor is extremely erratic. Sometimes, it's fairly accurate, other times it incorrectly records little to no sleep, and once it recorded that I was asleep when I was awake and not in bed. -I bought the pink version (because black was unavailable) and the band already looks discolored after 14 days of use. This is also plan to replace it with a black band.  Miscellaneous: -When I compare my phone's built-in step counter with the Fitpolo during outdoor walks, the Fitpolo has lagged behind by up to ~120 steps. So, I did some tests (indoor and outdoor) without the devices synced and compared the step count. Each time, the Fitpolo had fewer steps. I can't definitively say which is most accurate as it's possible that my phone is more sensitive to any movement and this is not necessarily a flaw with the Fitpolo. When I walk slowly and count my steps, the Fitpolo is pretty accurate.  Overall grade: B-. Despite some flaws, I plan to continue to use my Fitpolo because it meets nearly all of my intended needs and what it offers is reasonable for the price. Since my only desire is to monitor specific health data that my phone either doesn't track or misses (I have no interest in texts, calls, or other features unrelated to wellness), I'm satisfied with my purchase. 7 people found this helpful"
28,theunartist,"As far as I can tell, this is a really good value for what you get. It's a strong 4 star but lacking important details. The band is also on the weaker side.  This Smart Watch CANNOT properly function without first charging and using the APP for pairing. It does not pair directly to your Bluetooth but through the APP!!! I was able to pair/bind this using an Android phone with not issues. You will need to carefully follow screen prompts. After pairing with APP, the watch will automatically set time/date and language. Watch is ready to wear!!!  Here are the issues. There are no real instructions/directions, basically you will need to use common sense when trying to configure watch to notify you of incoming messages, SMS and other things like FB, IG, etc. The directions are very lacking to say the least. Paper instructions are much too vague with only a few hints, etc. You cannot use all options without first using the settings in the APP. The watch will most likely ""over count"" your steps but making sure you have correct weight and height in settings may help.  They should have, at a minimum, something online be it a video or website, explaining in greater DETAIL all the possible functions of the watch. I can understand reviews that state frustration with pairing, functions etc and it's probably due to lack of clear and detailed instructions.  All in all, would buy again. I really don't need the notifications but steps and heartbeat mostly. 12 people found this helpful"

30,Yehuda F.,I got this for my son and he is enjoying it very much. The battery charges in 25 min and lasts for 20 days!! My son doens't stop thanking me for this present I got him! He says the screen is very sharp and gets alot of compliments.
31,Shari,"Have been using the product for a little over a day and will probably change my opinion as I use it more...  I've used a fitbit for about 2 years and am slowly growing unhappy with the company and their ignoring of bugs and putting ask for features behind a paywall. Because of this I'm trying more reasonable priced watches.  In the picture, the Fitpolo is on the left and the fitbit on the right.  I will try and compare apples to apples. 1) before receiving my fitbit I could download the app and open it up and start to set up the information. the fitpolo I could download the app, but had to wait for the watch before it would open. (not a big deal)  2) get the fitpolo and tried to see if it would fit on my small wrist. Of course not, but neither did the fitbit. fitbit had a lot more option for wristbands. I finally found one for fitpolo and should be a good size. Should be here in a month or two (a little bigger deal, since I don't know if that is throwing off the accuracy. Also the watch is not comfortable to wear). Wonder if an extra hole or two might have made a difference.  3) face dial. both watches can change that information, but the fitbit has a lot more options. fitpolo only has about 5 different faces. None of them let me see the calorie, step count, or mileage on the main screen. I might be able to get use to it.  4) step accuracy is a little off. counting my steps it adds a couple. fitbit is a little more accurate. As of right now, fitpolo says I've walked 8922 steps today. fitbit has 7624. both them let me swing my arms, put hands in pockets, hands on hips, and hands wrapping coat around while walking. fitbit has issues pushing carts or strollers, haven't tried with fitpolo but I'm guessing will be the same  5) have not tested mileage yet. fitbit is fairly accurate and is behind fitpolo by about a mile.  6) calories I have no idea. they both determine this differently. the fitbit will count cals even when I'm not doing anything (it was counting cals even before I got the watch). I think fitpolo only counts when you're active. This might be a problem. The only two things I really care about is calories and sleep. If I can find the calorie count is consistent over a period of time, I can adjust.  7) sleep is another question mark. fitpolo says I slept last night for 5 hours 17 minutes. fitbit 6 hours 6 minutes. It seems I woke up after 90 minutes. fitpolo lost that time. I haven't tried to take a nap and see if it counts that. fitbit you seem you have to be asleep for about an hour before it counts  8) still getting use to app, but it doesn't really compare to all the information the fitbit has. At least it does seem accurate and I eventually can find what I need.  9) fitpolo is water proof (I haven't seen complaints that it isn't) where fitbit is just water resistant. It was nice to be able to hop into the shower without having to remove the watch  10) another nice feature of fitpolo is the find my phone feature. I know that will come in handy  11) some things fitpolo is missing are friends, counting floors, challenges. (I'm not sure about weight tracking)  12) keep moving feature. fitpolo has an option to remind you to move after a time you set. fitbit just has a 250 steps an hour challenge (can't change the number of steps and only limited to a certain number of hours a day)                               94 people found this helpful"

38,Rachel Fickel,"Bought this smartwatch to test out if I would maybe one day want a Samsung watch. But did not want to commit over $300 for something I may not even use because I thought they seemed overrated. But being a woman who wears business casual I find that I do not have pockets available for my phone and may not carry it all the time.  At first glance it is a very sleek design and comfortable to wear. Fits a slim wrist very well and doesn't cause any discomfort.  It does very simple functions. Tells time obviously. Checks heart rate, counts your steps, let's you control your music by pausing or skipping to the next song. I'm hoping to use it to stop/play my audio books. Has find your phone option. Will let you receive text message alerts, email alerts, Instagram alerts, and Twitter notifications. Does NOT allow you to respond back. If they send you a picture via text all you see is an X (image) type of font notification.  Only real complaint that I would have about this watch is that I can't change or upload any watch faces. But that is my fault as I did not fully research the watches capabilities and it does not support Android technology like that. Only connects to the app that it was designed to use to communicate with your phone.  If you want a watch that is within your budget under $50 this is it upon first glance. I will update (if I can remember) when I hit the 6 weeks mark of constant use to see if my opinion is the same.          21 people found this helpful"
39,Katie,Good watch for the price. Tracks steps well. Battery lasts a long time.
40,karsum,"I bought this primarily for a step tracker. I liked the option for fitness activities, but unfortunately due to health issues I haven’t been able to use them much. I almost returned this and then thought I’d give it another week. Then I realized I was pst the return date. My steps always seem to be low. If I go for a hike with my kids they will often get double the steps I do. If I shopping, it won’t count my steps if I’m pushing the cart. Even my health app on my phone shows about 1,000 steps or more than what the watch does. I’ll have to keep it for now, but I don’t recommend it if your purpose is yea king steps. I won’t be buying this brand again. I do like the VeryFitPro app. The fact that this watch worked with that app is why I bought it. The face is lit well. It doesn’t pull up well when I push the button. I can always read the face. The activity options are good. Most of the time it syncs with my phone to show calls and texts. But not always. 2 people found this helpful"
41,Angela C.,"I ordered a watch for my daughter and it was fantastic! The battery usually lasted about 5 days before needing a recharge. 9 months after we bought it, it suddenly stopped working. I reached out to the company to make a claim on the 1 year warranty and they responded within minutes. Within a week I had a replacement. I really appreciate companies that stand by their product and this company was wonderful to work with!  5 people found this helpful"
42,Jayden S.Mendez,"Overall I think this is the definition of you get what you pay for. The led screen doesn't actually go around the entire glass screen that the images actually show. The sleep tracking and heart rate tracking is not the best, it just sucks overall and really disappointing compared to the other brands out there. The step counter sucks too because it measures a step by you raising and lowering your arm, which isn't every accurate. I only use it for time, otherwise I just don't use it. Also whenever your not wearing it, while it's still on, it flashes a green led light that tries to scan if your wearing it, I think that feature is really annoying especially when it's charging and your about to fall asleep.

43,Lagertha,"So far I have been very pleased with this watch. I haven't figured out or used all of the features, but it does seem to be fairly accurate for calculating distance walked/run.

49,Amanda,"Love this tracker! I got this watch to replace an outdated, early model Garmin fitness tracker that stopped working. Found this and thought it was a great deal when looking at a cost comparison for comparable fitness watches.  I also wanted a watch that had a more feminine appearance so it wouldn’t look too conspicuous if wearing it out when not exercising. The watch is a nice muted pink with a rose gold faceplate border that looks exactly as pictured. Although a bit bulky, it’s not any bigger than any other tracker I’ve seen and much more attractive than many of them. Looks good when in business attire.  Pairing it with my iPhone 11 was a cinch and only took a few seconds! This watch has sooooo many awesome features that my former tracker didn’t have. * Love that it’s waterproof and unaffected by sweat or showering * The music control feature works great with YouTube. Awesome to not have to disrupt my workout to change songs * Accurately tracks steps and has a mapping feature to tracks distance, running progress, and calories burned as well as weekly totals * Super long battery life that lasts over a week and super easy magnetic charging (no more annoying battery changes or need for special screwdrivers to open) * I tested out having call, texts, and app notifications to the watch (worked perfectly) and then promptly chose to turn notifications off! I don’t like to be disturbed during a workout but nice to have the option if waiting for an important call * The left wrist option to turn the watch light on automatically works great * Many of the tracker’s features can be turned on or off through both the watch or app for maximum convenience  I have a medical condition and am pleased it has a heart monitor. I found that while the tracker does seem to track heart rate accurately most of the time, it doesn’t always send the appropriate information to the app. The monitor detected a heart rate of 178bpm during a workout (I could see it on the watch) but then recorded my max heart rate for the day in the app of 119bpm.  That said, the company doesn’t claim it tracks heart rate with medical accuracy and states that it is only a tool. Overall, the function performs as expected and is a useful feature to have.  The app is super easy to learn and use! It’s a great tool and intuitive. But definitely worth taking a look through the instruction manual to discover how to work all the functions as there are so many. I easily learned how to use it without reading the manual but am still finding awesome features I didn’t know existed!  Love this tracker! Much less expensive than my base model Garmin at a fraction of the price. Would highly recommend!                     13 people found this helpful"
50,Jenjen27,Watch worked great and been through a lot. What I didn’t like is that sometimes I would have to reconnect with the app for my notifications to work. The watch is waterproof to a degree. I used it in the shower and swimming at pools and water parks. The watch only lasted me eight months however. I used it at the beach and the saltwater may have been too much for the watch.
51,SteelmanMom,"Nice little watch for the price, 2nd one I bought for my son, after 2 years the band broke and he had scratches so i just bought him another one instead of a new vand.

That's why I chose 4 stars"

57,Kyleigh,I really like this watch. It does what i need it to do and it’s comfortable. Great for the price.
58,Elizabeth R," I really like this watch. As someone who is not tech savvy and has never used a smartwatch before, here are my initial thoughts on it:  - the watch screen looks sleek and slim. My coworker (who has an apple watch) didnt realize my watch was a cheap one since he said it looked like his at a glance. -the watch strap is comfy, soft, and flexible. But I just ordered some slimmer bands because I personally don't like wide straps. I do wish there were more watch strap options online for this model though. - the touch screen took some getting used to. Its not just like a phone and I accidentally tapped open the wrong app several times (especially when just swiping the screen) during the 1st hour of use. After that it was smooth sailing. - the battery life is wild! I'm at 44% and I charged it nearly a week ago. -i don't get emails or any app notifications unfortunately, even though I have that feature turned on. - I do get my texts and calendar reminders. I also get call notifications but you can't respond to texts or calls from the watch. -once in a while I don't get my texts on the watch. All I have to do to fix that is to turn the Bluetooth on my phone off and then back on to reset the connection. - the heart rate monitor and step tracker seem to work pretty well. The sleep tracker also seems to work well, but I've only used it once as I don't like to sleep with a watch on. - Using the app seems simple enough, I havent had any issues with it. - These are the features I don't really use, so I can't comment on them: sport, sport record, and alarm.  Overall I really like this watch. I only knocked off a star for certain minor inconveniences (email/app notifications not working for example, and limited watch band options online for customizing). I think that for the price its great. It performs how you would expect a cheap smartwatch to, while being sleek and pretty.               19 people found this helpful"

61,Keith Karouzos,"I’ve been wearing this watch 24/7 for 4 months and it’s wonderful! I had been wanting a smart watch for awhile, but I didn’t want to spend a ton of money in case I didn’t like it. I counted 1,000 steps walking and the app perfectly counted it however when I run on the treadmill it definitely doesn’t pick up my steps. I’m going to upgrade to an Apple Watch because I want to sync it to my iFit and get a better read when I’m doing more than walking. If you want a watch simply for walking and basic functions like timers, seeing messages, alarms, etc. then this is the perfect watch for you!"
62,Amazon Customer,Battery life is okay. Tracks steps
63,Tony,I bought this for my dad who is a senior. Its big enough for him to read the time and he likes that he can lift his hand to tell the time.
64,Kelly Farnsworth,"Unfortunately it rarely tracks any of my sleep, it just says 0h0m which is obviously inaccurate. On nights it did track, it stopped if I woke up in the night at all, whereas a Fitbit would always sense that I went back to sleep. Super inaccurate so that's why it's less stars as that is the main reason I got it. The step tracking does work great and the heartrate tracker about 50% of the time, battery life is good.

74,Laurie J.Kerkering,"The attractive, waterproof watch is sporty and has a great app to track sleep and steps."
75,Thrifty Shopper,"I liked this okay, more like four stars, for many months, for the price. The sleep tracking doesn't track naps. The heart monitor is not very accurate, clearly estimating my heart rate during workouts as much lower than it actually was. The step counter gave me a general idea of how active I was each day. I did like that I could get text message notifications, although this feature didn't always work consistently. My biggest issue is that now, after 9 months, it has been fritzing out, starting workouts when I didn't push anything, including in my sleep which wakes me up. Also sometimes the watch face doesn't respond to swipes or clicks. At this point it's pretty useless.  Update: the company contacted me about my concerns and offered a refund or a new watch. So, they are concerned about those who have a negative experience and if you post here, seem to be willing to make it right which makes it much less of a gamble to buy one. Here's hoping I get my refund!"
76,Amazon Customer,"Interface was easy to use, no problems with the setup. It’s very simple has a timer, stopwatch, allows you to view incoming text messages. Heart rate monitor seemed like it didn’t track all the time but it tracked when I needed it to for workouts. Unfortunately never got to try the sleep function because I’m new to wearing watches and didn’t want to wear it to bed, but I would’ve tried it if it didn’t stop working. Technically the screen lights up still so it’ll work to tell time but I can’t swipe anymore to use the features. Overall I like it and would continue to use but just bought it a month ago and it stopped working for the features I was utilizing it for. So I won’t be buying a new one. Hopefully it was just a bad egg. Also the battery is great, I’m very forgetful but I didn’t have to worry about charging it but once a week."

80,Mommy and Wife,"This watch overall is nice. The graphics are nice, it works with my phone well (although it took some tweaking in settings to get notifications besides just phone calls), and fits good. I have developed a slight rash where the monitor is and I take it off when showering/washing dishes and also after washing my hands to dry the watch and my skin. I've had this watch about 2 weeks and the band is already showing some discoloration. The steps counter is very off. I hadn't even gotten off the couch for the day and already had 190 steps; I am currently healing up from knee surgery so I'm not truly walking anywhere it's either crutches or rolling on a rollater chair. The heart monitor was accurate when compared to an apple watch while seated HOWEVER, I exercise regularly and notice the heart monitor is pretty inconsistent, my heart will be ramping one minute the next it's at like 80-90 when its still pounding. I have been do chair exercise cardio and strength since i am still recovering, my heart gets going and I sweat. So that makes me wonder about the validity of the calories burned aspect as well. I also cannot just start a workout from the watch, I have to start it through the app which is annoying. The music control only works with one music player so I can't use it with Spotify unless it's set as the main music player. I like the phone locator and DND options. It's good if you want it for anything other than fitness tracking.  One person found this helpful"

97,laura foray,So it's a great price for a fitness tracker watch. It is waterproof and that is why I chose it. It survived a beach vacation and lots of swimming in pools. The screen is bright enough to see even in the bright sun. The downside is that I cannot get my texts on here for some reason. It is definitely supposed to be able to receive texts. I have tried everything but no luck. Eventually I will be looking for a different watch that does in fact receive text and call alerts.

It's a little brighter than others I've used but still kinda hard to see in the sun. Also seems to track sleep well. It's super comfortable to wear. Disappointed that the band was dirty looking after only 4 days. Tried soap and water and those white scrubbing sponges. Nothing worked. So my pink band is stained grey.

115,Doris E. Puckerin,"after having a Fitbit Versa 2, I'm not so happy with this one!"
116,john pierman,Good Product
117,Jane Scheffres,"It doesn't track sleep very well, nor distance when walking. The band is too wide and clunky. Documentation doesn't explain how to find some features. Still, for the sale price of $35, it's about what I expected. If it works for more than 6 months, it will have outlasted my previous smart watch, which cost $150. One person found this helpful"
118,dianejmac,the screen turns on by itself all the time with movement. Maybe because I do not have it tightened to the point where the band bugs me. Would love it more if it was not turning the screen on all the time.
119,Terri C.,It’s a nice looking watch. I’ve only used it less than one day so far so I can’t say much. It does check heart rate and I get alerts plus the battery is holding up well.  One person found this helpful
120,Pablo P.,"We love the watch’s activity and heart rate tracking functions. The swiping function of the screen started failing right after Amazon’s one-month return policy ended, and FitPolo’s customer service is AMAZING. They responded immediately with a real person trouble-shooting our problem, and when it wasn’t fixable, they sent us a new watch within a few days. Their customer service made all the difference!

123,Mark Evenson,My picky wife likes this more than the Apple Watch !
124,Wat Tyler,"'Wrist sense' feature doesn't work well, it kept lighting up the screen at night when I would roll over... or sometime just a minor arm movement. The backlight is very bright, so I had to turn off that feature.  Sleep tracking seems okay, not sure how accurate that is. The app is so so. For heart rate all it tracks is 'resting' which seems a bit silly.  'Activity' feature doesn't seem very useful, other than displaying end of activity information. Can't find any of that in the app.  Battery life for my usage has been excellent, at 24 days battery life was down to 10%.  ** UPDATE ** The backlight comes on randomly. It will wake me and/or my wife up. Pressing the button sometimes doesn't turn it off. Seems pointless tracking sleep and then waking the user up with random bright light. The do not disturb feature doesn't keep it from lighting up...and wrist sense is already off. Reboot did not resolve.  ** UPDATE 2 ** Seller reached out and offered to send a new watch. I didn't see the point, however I was willing to try just in case the random backlight issue was hardware related. No change in the functionality.  I did discover that maybe shutting down the app reduced or eliminated the spurious backlight issue. I can't be sure. Of course shutting down the app disables alerting features which to me seems like a huge issue.  We now have one connected to my wife's phone and so far is hasn't lite up that we've noticed. She often sleeps with her arms under the covers so we may not notice.  +1 star for customer service trying..."
125,Cody,As you can see I damaged the left part of the charger in a vacuum accident on the left side and now I have to buy a new charger because of the minuscule damage. I actual watch is awesome in every aspect 
126,Kelly Gray,"The watch itself is great so far; the app is easy to use, it tracks pretty reliably, and it seems pretty resistant to water at least when washing your hands. However, it came with the packaging already open and torn up, totally unwrapped, and the product didn't say anything about being used. Very unprofessional. Side note: there's no tracking for skating on the athletic workouts, only cycling. "
127,cassie baumann,"I bought this product to mostly count my steps and keep track of my sleep. I also wanted something I could use to help find my phone when I lose it throughout the house. I have had an Apple Watch in the past but when I ordered this I kept in mind I was getting what I paid for so I didn’t expect anything more than to solely count my steps and be water resistant. I have become extremely disappointed in the sleep tracker. I have two under 1.5 and with how much I’m up in the middle of the night between the two, it counts that time I’m up as “light sleep” so I don’t get an accurate amount of hours slept the next morning. Or if I’m laying my kiddos down at night and I’m “resting” it also counts it as light sleep if it happens in the late PM. I have been extremely surprised by the battery life tho so it has that going for itself. As far as waterproof goes I have gotten it wet while washing dishes or doing baths with the kids but I haven’t fully submerged it for a long period yet. So waiting on that."
128,Chelle,"The text & symbols were very small & you can’t adjust them. Also, the screen is difficult to move. So, I return this product."
129,Scotty Tandberg,I ordered this watch thinking it had fall detection but it doesn't. Thats on me really. It's overall a good product so far. I'm just disappointed that it doesn't have fall detection because that's the main reason for ordering it.
130,Matthew Journet,I love the watch and all it's features but why can't my contacts stay connected I have to pick 8 contacts daily.
131,stacey beck,This is the second exact tracker I have bought. I find it motivating to count my steps so in enjoy this product. I find it easy to use and appreciate it being waterproof as well. It shipped quickly. You can’t beat the value. Thanks so much!
132,Troy Martin,"I absolutely love this watch, Its simple and easy to use. I had the same watch for almost 3 years until it finally died while swimming in the ocean."
133,Amazon Customer,"When your watch stops working after 2months and you report the problem, NO ONE WILL GET BACK TO YOU this is my second watch. Replaced the first one because of a broken case where the strap attached. The second one lost led display and I can’t get anyone to answer my email that I sent through the app along with a picture"
134,Lindelu,"I purchased this in Jan 2022 and have been very pleased with the watch. I can set alarms, see texts, see whose calling, track steps, heartrate, sleep tracker, control Sirius XM music phone app and Amazon music phone app, pretty much everything I wanted a smartwatch to do for me. I only have to charge it once a week so that's a very nice bonus. I've had people think it was an iWatch, I don't have an iPhone but an Android, specifically Samsung S10 and it paired perfectly with the app on my phone. For the price, you can't beat it. I'm looking forward to doing some swimming with it this summer so hopefully it holds up better than my water resistant fitbit. And I love the teal green color! One person found this helpful"
135,KodeeDahl,I recently got this watch after I got rid of my apple watch. I had an iphone and switched to android. I have loved this watch since I got it. I wear mine all day and it is pretty much always at 90% battery or more at the end of the day. I mostly use it to keep track of my fitness throughout the day. Highly recommend it.
136,Brah,"Had the same problem with a NON-chest band product a few years ago. Sure it's fine for a walk or a casual laid back bike ride. But when I got my heart rate above 145-150 while chopping wood, no good. Still a decent product for the price."
137,Kim,My 11 year old daughter uses this watch. She likes to track her steps and how much activity she gets during the day. I like it so I can see how much activity she gets so I know she is not sitting around all day. The battery lasts a couple of days.
138,JG,"Color: GREENVerified Purchase I love the green colored watch. I bought this watch as a cheaper alternative to an apple watch since I only need it for counting my steps throughout the day and it works great at doing that. Only downside is, like most watches, it only counts steps if you're walking with your arms at your side. So when pushing a stroller or carrying something they are not counted."
139,Beverly,"I bought this watch for my Granddaughter for her birthday. I haven't given it to her yet, so I don't know how it is working. I can answer this after the 17th of August. Sorry I'm no help yet."
140,heidi,"This watch is awesome!!! I got it for tracking my steps, workout goals - the battery life is amazing and doesn’t drain literally at all!!! I had a Apple Watch - that drained soo much ~ This definitely is a smart buy!!!!"
141,Fishh,"First and foremost, the battery life on this watch is insanely good! This watch can easily last 5 days. All the functions work as described. My only complaint is I wish you could change the display, but considering the price point, that’s hardly an issue. Also, the app works pretty well and is easy to use. Would definitely recommend this watch!"
142,Carol Luce,"This watch is really great for the price. Features and appearance were nice. Useful, slim, easy to use. However, mine broke after about 3 months of use... where the wrist wrap connects to the watch, the connecting piece snapped so there is no fixing it. I am bummed. Really enjoyed using it at work and just started using it for fitness. Might buy again but will look for options that may last longer first. Just beware, it may not last long!"
143,Hims,"Very good product in terms of functionality, battery life, time to get recharge I am overall satisfied. The only thing that bothered me was the quality of the strap which gets dirty (blackish) after couple of use. I have to clean it with alcohol to make it look good.  Would suggest the seller to sell extra straps too just in case someone is tired of cleaning the straps."
144,Brenda M,It supposed to be waterproof but I Sean with it and it died.
145,KT,"It's cute and not as big as my last one, which is why I bought it. The step counter, which is the main reason I have it - to motivate myself to get at least 10k per day - is way off. I've compared it to treadmill, another watch, and marked hiking trails. I did reach out to the company and they said that I may have lied about my height or weight or put it on wrong. It was a strange reply! I was just asking if it could perhaps be defective. It didn't cost enough to go through the hassle of a return, but I won't be wearing it. Also, the messages like text, etc. only seem to come through some of the time."
146,David D,Is not waterproof 2/2 tries with same watch thinking it was a fluke…
147,Jamie Yearicks,"Got for my daughter, to make sure she could take care of a watch. Works just like the name brands and was a fraction of the cost. Very happy"
148,Brooke Hall,**UPDATE** I reached out to the seller and they tried everything they could to get the watch to work correctly. Unfortunately nothing worked. They were kind enough to offer me a new one free of charge while not having to mess with returning the old one. This new watch works much better than the first one. Unfortunately it still does not always alert me of text messages even when I’m directly beside my phone but is much more accurate than the first watch. Not a deal breaker at all for me. I would definitely recommend the watch over paying much higher prices for other brands.  I thought I would love this watch based on the reviews. It was a Christmas gift from my husband and I thought it was a fantastic price compared to the Apple Watch and fit bit and was supposed to do the same things. Unfortunately my watch constantly disables Bluetooth and I do not always get notifications of texts or phone calls even when I have my phone in my hand and the watch on my wrist. It also doesn’t always recognize the wrist lift feature so I have to push the button to see the time because it doesn’t recognize I’m trying to look at it. It’s hit or miss all the time. I wonder if I got a faulty one. I wouldn’t buy again because of this. I hate it because all the other features seem to be fine to my knowledge. I just don’t understand why it works sometimes and doesn’t other times. Very frustrating. 166 people found this helpful
149,Tani Rae Standridge,I thot this was a good cheap alternative to fit bit as it tracked steps and had a timer. all i used really. but now it won’t charge after only 2 months. I Emailed company and was happy to get a response offering a replacement or refund even tho return date had passed.
150,Amazon Customer,"I wanted a fitness tracker, not a smart watch. Unfortunately, the fitness features don't measure up to my previous Fitbit even though that was just a basic model. It is fashionable and often mistaken for an apple watch at first glance. In this case it's true that you get what you pay for. So as a budget option it works."
151,chandrashekar konka,It surprised me with its look on wrist and performance. I’d recommend this strongly and it won’t disappoint you if you are looking to track activity and sleep.
152,M. Fouts,Great watch

My other one and also a new one from a different brand I received yesterday, will track 15,000 steps plus for my day. This one would only say I had like 5,000 steps if I was lucky. I'm very active and on a weight loss journey, so I need a product that counts steps correctly and this one wasn't it. I sent back and got a refund"
159,Mary,"I like how accurate it tracks your steps and workouts. I try to get my steps in every day now that I got this. Love all the other tracking things to, sleep and heart rate. Really nice tracker."
160,Grimaud,"The watch was for my daughter who runs quite a bit. She was interested in her heart rate, steps, mileage, and tracking the routes she ran. I didn’t know if this was something she would use consistently so I didn’t want to spend a ton. This was an inexpensive choice that appeared to fit the needs.  Pros: heart rate, battery life, step count, and mileage all seem to be working well - although the mileage is off by about 1/5 of a mile over the course of a 5k run). This isn’t a deal breaker for us because we already know the distances for most trails in our area.  Cons: this watch DOES NOT track running routes. The information indicates it does, but it is not the case. You can only track your movements if you also take your phone on the run. I feel the write up in the listing is disingenuous with this feature.  Overall, this watch will work for now, but if my daughter does use it consistently for a few months we will probably upgrade."
161,Lishia,"I got the product yesterday and after wearing it for about 24 hours now here are my thoughts: I don't like how you have to wear the watch so tight for it to pick up steps. (It mentions that you should wear it close to the skin to get an accurate heart rate, but in my case I also noticed that you need to do that for steps as well. Speaking about steps...I dont think it's properly recording all of mine which is a shame because that's the whole reason I bought it. I've been to two stores and running around for half of the day and its records only 2000 steps which compared to when I had my fitbit it would've been way higher than that. The style is cute, the interface on the product is pretty nice but unfortunately I needed the pedometer to work properly so I'll probably be returning this one and trying something else. And I thought the reviews I read were so promising too."
162,Ruby Parker,"Pros: Seriously awesome battery life Does count steps Tracks sleep well Definitely water proof !AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE VIA FACEBOOK MESSENGER!  Cons : Step tracker is not sensitive enough, so if your pushing say a stroller (like I do every morning) it won't track those steps. It also won't track when you are pushing a shopping cart.  A 2 hour nap or rest will not be tracked on the sleep tracker portion of the watch And honestly I absolutely hate the app that goes with this watch. It is not as user friendly as it could be. Also the locate my phone doesn't work for distance, if you aren't right on top of your phone it won't work.  Over all it's a 4 star. It has great perks but drawbacks. Thankfully it's a cheap watch and as long as your not pushing anything with wheels it works wonders haha. I'm all in all okay with the watch until I can afford a better one. I would recommend this for a preteen or teenager as a starter watch for sure. Which is probably where this watch will be going as soon as I get a better one.                13 people found this helpful"

I've had it two days now and haven't had to charge it yet so that's cool. So easy to use and the app was simple too. Was able to even connect to my Google fit which I have everything linked to.

187,Leigh,"The watch is almost perfect- except for the accuracy of the sleep tracker and the fact that it’s missing a few features that were implied by the listing but in the app FAQ it says “not all our devices have these features.”  Regarding the sleep, it says I wake up at 9:42. Every day. I know that I’m not waking up at 9:42, as I’m usually sleeping in late or waking up much earlier. I don’t have any alarms at 9:42 or any other reason it should end sleep tracking at that time every day. It also doesn’t track any naps and often doesn’t register the times I wake up in the night and then go back to sleep. I’m not sure if this is a bug or what is going on.  With the missing features, I was expecting to have a find my phone feature and a camera control feature, and have neither. I was really looking forward to the phone feature as I lose things often. I can live without these, but it is a misleading listing and is disappointing. I don’t know if I just have a bad device, or I don’t know how to get the device that does have the listed features.  Also, as some reviews said, the pink band stains badly, but since bands are easily replaceable that’s not too bad. One person found this helpful"

I like that I can see my notifications on it, I like how I can find my phone with it, the only thing I don't like is I don't think it's very accurate with my steps. Watching my steps is the main reason I bought this watch but when I go grocery shopping, or anywhere with my kids and I push a cart or a stroller it doesn't detect my steps. If I'm walking normal not carrying anything it tracks the steps perfectly, but if I'm pushing something it doesn't. So that is frustrating. Overall it's great for the price, I would recommend if you are looking for a smart watch. But if your looking to track your steps I would not recommend."

It does exactly what I wanted but so much more. In addition to steps/miles, I can also track my heart rate and sleep patterns. I am still discovering things about my Fitpro. 😍"
201,Valerie N.,"I ordered this product a month ago, and it has been great. I mostly use it to track my heart rate and my progress when I go on hikes.  The battery life lasts a full week, so I don't have to be worrying about charging it very often. (If you forgot to charge your watch and you're in a hurry, it will take around 30-45min to charge completely)  The mobile app is pretty straightforward, not complicated - it automatically links the watch to your phone and tracks your progress.  Also, the watch has a feature that detects when you are not moving (running, walking, etc) and will remind you to walk.  The watch is also water-resistant - I never take it out when I wash my hands, dishes, etc. and it is still working perfectly.  Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase. The pink watch looks very elegant and matches most of my clothes. (The only con is that it gets dirty really easy, but that has happened to me with other light pink watches too)            5 people found this helpful"

Battery life seems strong, heart monitor seems accurate, she doesn't use the sleep monitor much so no comment there. I'd say the biggest disappointment is I've not been able to find a replacement band for this watch. I've tried a 20mm band and a 19mm band, both were too big. I don't have the patience to try an 18mm, I feel like it's a 19mm after measuring it several times with a micrometer, I was really hoping bands would be replaceable. Also, she notes the app is lacking some options, and wishes the watch faces could be customized to more extent. I think it comes with 4 faces on the watch, but you're not able to add your own custom one."

207,Amanda,"I love it. I’ve been wanting an Apple Watch, but this does just about what I need it to. I use it to track calories for my home workouts and dog walks. Not sure how accurate the heart rate monitor is, but seems to be okay. I use the timer when cooking food. It’s nice to know when someone is calling me and not having to have my phone in the same room as me, say if my phone was in the office and I was on the floor, I still receive the text conversations and phone calls. Cons: -cannot reply to messages from the watch and really wish I could. -wish I could upload my own watch interface instead of the few they give -the WORST is how awful the pink wristband looks. It has turned a blue color and looks completely dirty     "
208,Amazon Customer,Loved my watch untill the 90 days were up and then it broke.. then the company reached out to me and replaced it for me!so happy
209,S. Riv,"It's a nice watch. Good tracking. Only complaint is the band. It'll pop loose at times. I wear it loosely, it gets snagged on what I'm doing. I wear it tighter and it pops off when I bend my wrist. The battery life is shorter than other watches I've had."
210,m. athey,"this is my 2nd watch from this company. the 1st lasted about 2 years before the little clasp that holds the watch strap broke, and i figured it was time for an upgrade. battery life is excellent, charges SUPER quickly, the heart rate monitor / sleep tracker is accurate as is the step count, when compared with my smart phone or other devices. definitely recommend this watch for people who are less interested in the 'smart watch' functions, but want a good fitness tracker."
211,Dean,I bought this watch 2 years ago. It quit working so I bought the same one again. The 2nd one battery lasts about half as long as the first watch. I have never figured out the feature that is supposed to record your route on your phone.
212,Robin Smith,Works perfect so far. Had for over a month. Battery life is great compared to my old fitbit.
213,Miss Jo Wicks,"I constantly have to reset my watch to the app as it doesn't maintain the sync for calls, texts, social media notifications. It does keep great tracking of my steps, sleeping, and heart rate though. The battery dies based on how often I receive phone calls, notifications, etc. I probably have to recharge it 2x a week sometimes 3. I preferred my earlier version of this watch, it was set up and go, no worries other than the periodic sync. You have to sync this watch constantly to assure you receive phone calls, texts, notifications, etc. Next time I will make a better-informed choice. I'm very disappointed in this version but only chose it because I already had the app and didn't want to lose all of my previous information. One person found this helpful"
214,Sky,"The battery life is fantastic on this thing, the app works well, and for the most part I think it's accurate on the sleep tracking and heart beat monitor. I haven't put it deep into water or swam with it or anything, cause I don't want it to break, but it does seem pretty durable. The wallpapers for it aren't my style, it randomly disconnects from my phone, and sometimes my wrist gets a little itchy wearing it but I enjoyed it so far especially so I don't have to always have my phone in my pocket to track steps"
215,beingisbelieving,"I actually think this is a great little watch! So much so that I bought my husband one too. It has a very clean interface, is easy to use and bind to the phone. It's accurate compared to similar wrist wearable fitness trackers (I have a heart rate strap for if I really need some data during a workout, the ONLY way to get a truly accurate reading) but I like that this tracks throughout the day. I enjoy the sleep tracking as well, and the relax option to remind me to take a few mindful breaths throughout the day. Those 2 features alone make it worth it to enhance my wellness and/or set an alarm to remind me of my goals. This particular model does receive text messages/email/social alerts if you want then, you cannot respond to them from the watch. I saw a few that said they had the ability to control the camera shutter of your phone remotely which WOULD be handy for taking those progress pics. Battery life lasts a week or 2, I usually try to charge it on the weekend. The app has the option of continual running in the background or only running when open if you are concerned about the battery life/data usage on your phone.  12 people found this helpful"
216,Aprille,"Love the look of the watch. Looks very similar to the Apple Watch. It’s lightweight and waterproof (but I still take it off before showering). I bought it just to track my steps and keep myself accountable to be active (since the quarantine has made me so lazy).  Two gripes though. One, the watch won’t sync with the app you’re supposed to download. And I tried everything. I restarted my phone. I deleted the app and reinstalled. I fully charged it. I tried every thing the app suggests to try to sync but doesn’t work . Second, although the pink strap is cute, the “metal” piece that keeps the watch strapped in is actually plastic and is starting to rub off onto the pink strap. I’m scared that since it’s plastic that eventually it’ll snap off and the watch will fall off if I’m not paying attention.    8 people found this helpful"
217,Jess,This has lasted longer than any of the 5 fitbits I've wasted money on. Better battery life than any other one I've used as well. App could use improving but it works.
218,54321,"This is a great watch for a practical price. It took me several months to find a good watch that would fit my wrist and not slip off. This one fits my 14cm wrist comfortably and not too loose! (I use it at it's smallest closure, so it would also fit large wrists too if adjusted to any of the larger holes) The watch has many useful features, and it's easy to figure out how to operate. The app is also easy to use. The one issue I had was that it never seems to stay connected to bluetooth, and I don't know how to reconnect it. I needed a smartwatch mainly for the heart rate monitor, and it is working well so far. Another feature I really like about this watch is the ability to control music from the watch. Very useful, and not all watches had that. There are many great features and uses of this watch. Basically everything you'd need from a smartwatch. The sport modes serve the purpose well, making it a good fitness watch. Also, the app is easy and the customer service is very helpful. I didn't even expect all these extra benefits, but very pleasantly surprised.      4 people found this helpful"
219,Peter C,"I wear this watch every day and love it. I like that texts come to me without having to have my cell. Love that it doesn’t make a lot of noise or have too many bells and whistles. It’s very high quality and the battery last for over 2 weeks, even with wearing it daily. I’ve had it for over 6 months and am very pleased."
220,Shopaholic,"I’ve never worn my watch in the water. I finally decided to swim with it while on vacation and immediately after, it stopped working. It’s fine as a step counter. Definitely NOT waterproof. Buy something of higher quality if you intend to use it at the water park or to track your aqua workout."
221,Patricia Zubrod,"I’ve had this for 3 months now, I waited to do a review to make sure it continued to work. Overall, I’ve been very happy with this product. I question the accuracy of the sleep monitoring but it seems pretty close. I run/walk a lot so I like all of the stats it includes. I did have about a month where the running stats didn’t work. It would tell me overall time and distance but nothing else. I waited a couple weeks and they just magically started again so not sure what happened. Battery life is good but I turned my screen sensor off. With that off, I can get the battery to work up to 2.5-3 weeks without a charge. The only notifications that come through are calls for me so if you’re trying this for notifications/phone connectivity I wouldn’t recommend. One person found this helpful"
222,Justin L,"I was using this to track my heart rate and sleep for medical reasons. Not only isn't it accurate but the seller was rude and gave excuse after excuse for it not working as it should per its advertising. Reasons include Having dark skin color, drinking water before going to bed, the watch being to lose or to snug.  The watch said I was awake in the middle of the night when I wasn't, it said I was sleeping for 2 or 3 hours straight when I was up in the morning---consistently. On nights I slept for 4 hours it said I was in bed for over 9. That's a big difference. The heart monitor did not provide accurate results either. I liked the look and functionality I thought I was getting but they should have advertised the ""features of the watch as heart and sleep monitoring --intended for entertainment purposes only, not for actual accurate data monitoring"". Seller's response with excuses is below, in the end I was directed to Amazon-the seller wouldn't help and although it is NOT working and has NEVER worked right, they would not replace or refund. Amazon did- they are amazing. Thankful for their customer service.  Thank you for sending me the images here, I checked and found your watch worked in normal. As your package was fulfilled by Amazon, you could contact Amazon and return the watch to Amazon warehouse for refund if you want. And you can also follow these steps below ①Adjust the wearing loose-fitting, not too loose (we are used to loose a little during sleep, there is a certain probability of misidentification not wearing). ②The current sleep algorithm only records sleep that lasts more than 3 hours, accurate sleep data needs to be generated one hour after waking up. If people who often get up at night is likely to identify not, it is recommended that reasonable arrangements for sleep time, and drink less water before going to bed. ③ Individuals with darker skin color, the watch has a great probability of misidentifying not worn and thus sleep data cannot be detected. 3 people found this helpful"
223,GMun,"I wasn't expecting a FitBit clone for 30 dollars, so middle-of-the-road will have to do. The app is serviceable. I don't really use it to track sleep or steps. The watch itself is fine. The band is comfortable, the screen is bright, and the resolution is fine. Navigating the screens is a bit clunky though. Battery usage is weird. I can charge it all night, be at 95% at like 6 PM that evening, then inexplicably at 70% two hours later while never increasing my usage of the watch. The heart rate monitor, the real reason I got it, works fine. I've checked it against a manual reading, and it's either exact or right next to it. I'm sure most people would need all the other functions, and the app does track everything, but for a basic heart beat monitor, it's fine. 3 people found this helpful"
224,Jackie Wallace,I can go an entire week without having to charge it. It tracks exercise and steps pretty accurately. I don’t feel like the sleep tracking is super accurate though. It is also doesn’t stay linked to my phone for text notifications. One person found this helpful
225,Randall B. Campbell,"There seemed to be no way to overcome the problems I had with the watch, so, as promised, I'm reducing my score to a '1' and have already returned the product.  Earlier review: I'm provisionally giving this watch a '2 Star', but I'm open to modifying if I can learn ways to overcome its shortcomings. I bought it primarily to use as a heart rate monitor while I'm exercising. I exercise outdoors in variable terrain, and my wish is to have a more-or-less real time monitor so I can adjust my pace to stay in the aerobic zone. I realize that heart rate has to be computed over some period of time, but calculating it over 10 or 15 seconds should be close enough and accurate enough. A drawback of a ""no-brand"" product like this is that you can't find out detailed information about how it works. So - the heart rate seems to have a delay. Maybe I could work with it if I knew how much, but it's not obvious from using it. And then, much of the time it reads high. How do I know? Because I've travelled my route dozens of times, occasionally checking my pulse the old-fashioned way. This device is giving me readings more than 20% higher than I've ever observed. The other, pretty major, flaw is that outdoors in bright sunlight, I can hardly read the display. I set in on the Running activity, so it will stay on that for the duration. The elapsed time and the H.R. readouts are small, and with my eyes adapted to bright sunshine (on snow, sometimes), I certainly can't read it at a glance. If I stop, and shade the watch with my hand, I can just, maybe, make out the numbers. That display needs to be bigger, and a brightness adjustment would also help. If I can't find a way around these issues, I'll return it, and reduce my score to a '1'. My hope is that someone reading this will inform me of adaptations I can make to render it useful. In that case I'll increase the score. 4 people found this helpful"
226,ELH INC,"I purchased the fruit watch but after one week and returned it. I could not accept the watch required daily charging, a unique charging cord. This watch does everything my returned watch does but charging required 3-5 days"
227,Amazon Customer,"I had some trouble figuring it out, especially the notifications. I finally googled it and found a more complete pdf manual and all is well. Only day 2 but I think this will work perfect for my needs, step and sleep tracking, and message alerts. I love that the time is large enough for me to read too!!!! I only wish the band size was compatible with an iwatch to have more options available."
228,Karla Sanchez,I’ve had this product for a few months now for work and it’s good for that but if you’re expecting an Apple Watch dup don’t buy.
229,Marly Delk,I don’t like the fact that I have to buy the app for it to work 🥲
230,Sandra Morrone,I use it for notifications it’s great
231,Ktnvasmom,"I have had this watch for 3 months now and I am quite pleased with it. It does all that it claims except for 2 things: “Find A Phone” and text notifications. I touch the icon on the watch for the FAP function but it doesn’t do anything. With the text notifications, I have it marked in the app to send me my notifications but it doesn’t. It does, however, send my Facebook Messenger notifications. However, I would buy this watch again and I highly recommend it. If you don’t want to pay for or need all the functions of Apple Watch, this watch is just right."
232,Joan Liut,"I was glad to find an affordable smart watch. My son is learning disabled, and a complicated watch may have not been a good fit for him at all. This one is doing fine, and is one of his must-have accessories."
233,Samantha Morris,I really like this item. The battery lasts a really long time I only have to charge it every 3 to 4 days which is AWESOME!!! I also like the fact that I know exactly how many steps I take a day and it's neat how it also tracks your sleep.Ive never really been one to wear watches but I like this one it's not too big and not too small it's just right. I definitely recommend!!!
234,Natgas Guy,"I bought this tracker to count walking/running steps, time elapsed and distance traveled. Time and steps are recorded accurately. However, distance traveled is “steps X stride length” and the app doesn’t allow the user to enter his stride length. Instead (apparently) the app estimates stride length based on user height. Based on prior measurements, the stride length estimate is low for me resulting in distance calculations about 15% low. I am trying to compensate by increasing “my height” but haven’t found the sweet spot yet. Sent email to company asking for a height/stride length conversion chart but no response. Regarding other features, I don’t use the other features so can’t comment."
235,Sharon,"Love the watch so far. Only had it a few days, but so far, so good."
236,Dec,It is a little bit difficult to figure out at 1st but after you figure it out it's a very useful tool to help through everyday life and exercise
237,Amc,"Pros: Came in time Nice looking watch Good battery life Good at track heart rate  Cons: Does not link to Samsung health for those with Samsung devices Steps tracking is very inaccurate (depending on your daily life). I was on the elliptical with mine to track my heart rate and it was also counting steps. So I had an extre 4000 steps it counted from me being on the elliptical.  For its price, I'd say it's fair. But I am returning it."
238,K.B.,"Pros: small and lightweight for tiny little wrists like mine, good battery life, and the functions work done. Cons: phone location has to be on all the time to sync to the app, can't turn off the feature to lift your wrist to light up the screen, it's either always on or it turns on as you move (annoying during sleep), can't change the screen layout, app interface is subpar"
239,Kathryn,"My daughter loved this watch - while it worked. Now it only displays the day and time. It will not connect to her phone and you cannot scroll through to use any features. There is no customer service for this product, so BUYER BEWARE!! The product website is super sketchy and the link to request support is not a valid. Their 12-18 month warranty is totally bogus. Try another brand. One person found this helpful"
240,Olivia,I purchased one of these watches about 1.5 years ago and it did better than expected until the entire face popped off. But I want too upset about it since it had lasted me about a year and I was a little rough on it. I bought my second one two months ago and much to my dismay the touch features have stopped working and I cannot navigate the face of the watch. Not sure what happened there.
241,Stuck in Gumbo,"I am extremely pleased with this watch. Have had quite a few before this one, including a couple of Fitbits, and feel this is the best, especially for the price. One thing I like very much is the length of time between charges. For me, being able to track my sleep every night without having to worry about the amount of charge every day is a real plus...I haven't tested it in terms of the days it lasts, but I would say it is easily eight days between charges. Another nice feature is the fact that it involves only one button press to access the functions, as opposed to some watches which have three..or four...always a pain to remember which one is which. I also like the fact that I can shower with it on with complete confidence that it is waterproof. You can believe the following or not, but it is true. About a week or two after I purchased it, I accidentally managed to put it in the wash with my clothing. Okay..I am an idiot. At any rate, when I discovered it, and before putting it in the dryer, I checked it and it immediately came on as if it had never gone into the wash...no condensation, no nothing...it was simply cleaner than when it went in...I highly recommend this watch to anyone! 127 people found this helpful"
242,Chris,Sleep tracking isn’t very accurate.
243,Raquel Tellez,"Very good fitness watch for price. I like that it looks like a smart watch and it doesn't look oversized on my little wrist. The app kind of sucks though. It doesn't track sleep accurately. It also un-binds unexpectedly. That aspect sucks only because my alarms don't go off and it screws my day up a little. GPS is pretty good and so is the running tracker. I like that I get sms,SMS, email, messenger alerts..I can't reply on watch, but I didn't buy it for that purpose, so I don't really care lol. Battery life is also very good and the music controller is very cool and convenient feature to have on your wrist especially when your exercising. All in all, I love the watch. The app needs serious improvement though..I will be getting my son once of these despite minimal annoyances with the app. Good buy. Good price. "

246,PC,"This watch is a good value and fairly easy to use but there are some problems for me. The first, it’s made in China. That information was not available in the Amazon description. If I had known that, I would never have ordered it because I’m a firm believer in Made in America. Second problem - don’t rely on the directions for help. They are written in such a small font and a small manual that even with my glasses and a magnifying glass, I could not read them. It would be nice to be able to change the watch display face but I can’t figure out how to do that. Third problem - I’ve had the watch for a week and the pink band is already showing wear. I foresee it looking dirty and worn very quickly. Also, the band is very long and the piece of plastic that is supposed to hold it in place doesn’t. It slides around a lot and is very annoying. This watch does as described and has a nice bright display. It is a good bargain for the price. It can be operated without directions (I’ve had fitness watches before so I have a experience with their setup) if you know what you are doing. 24 people found this helpful"
247,Brenda L.,I like my fitpro except that it's has sensitivity issues from the start. I should have gotten it exchanged but never did. The light turns on and off when I roll over at night. It randomly ask if I want to change my display at least 10 times a day. When I try to swipe it won't respond. I didn't exchange it thinking it was me doing something wrong but it was the equipment. Ugh I really wanted it to work correctly.
248,Angelica Figueroa,I like this watch so much I wanted a fitness watch to watch my steps and calories and this does that plus more ! You can change your music like skip forward or back which is good and it can check your blood pressure tooo. It’s super cool and it literally lasts me like a week without charge
249,Clint,"In the description it says this watch will notify you of calls, sms and emails, guess what? It doesn't, I tried for two days to figure this out with no luck, instruction booklet doesn't even tell you how to turn it on or off, never figured that part out, I did get it to come on by hooking the charger to it. I don't recommend this at all, returned for refund."

Also the watch displays a weekly summary of my fitness goals as well as daily totals for steps by just gliding my finger up on the main screen (see pic). The timer function has been awesome to use when cooking/grilling. The VeryFitPro solftware for my phone is easy to use, and connected effortlessly via bluetooth to the watch to keep track of my daily activities. I can even control music playing on my phone via the watch...pretty cool. The band is really comfortable on me. All in all, this is a great fitness trackiner/watch for the money given all it can do.

You can't expect Apple quality when you're only willing to spend 30 bucks. So if you're willing to let go of some features, it's a great ""dup."""
253,Emily,"I honestly really like this watch! People keep thinking it's an apple watch. It's really sleek in design and is quite adjustable, there's a lot of loopholes. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because the app is honestly stupid. It's not helpful and mine doesn't even load. It does show the time, my texts, and informs me of incoming calls. I can also hang up on calls. It also shows my steps. It does say I should be able to control my music on it, but I cannot figure it out. I don't know if it's user error or what. But also my alarms don't go off on it either which is an advertised feature. So their are pros and cons but I think the pros outweigh the cons. If you're debating it, I say do it! Just try it out and then if you really like it then upgrade. 3 people found this helpful"

255,SherryL.,"I have had this watch for about a week and I like that it's simple and provide what I needed. I wanted something that'll tell time, track my workout and sleep. Everything else is a bonus.  Pros: Battery life is excellent. I only had to charge about once a week. I like the magnetic design where you don't have a hole for plugs to collect dust. It's lightweight and easy to keep clean. The app that works with the watch is great.  Cons: Step count is very inaccurate. I have not gone out of bed and I already have 25 steps lol. When you turn your wrist to see time it takes a few sec for the screen to show up.  Reason I am returning: It worked fine for about a week until it gave me a blister overnight. I didn't do anything different from how I have been wearing this watch for the past week. I woke up feeling a bit sore on the skin so I removed it to find a blister right under the watch screen. I don't do water activities or shower with it on. I don't put lotion or sunscreen at where I wear this watch.  So, I liked this watch till today due to the blister. Maybe this particular one is defective but I will be moving on and try a different brand next time.          3 people found this helpful"

The messaging and music features don't seem to automatically work or I have to do something else to set those up but I don't really care about them so whatever. Would have been nice for this to work with MyFitnessPal but it works with Apple Health which then works with MFP so that worked out nicely. I would have liked to be able to set my heart rate monitor to alert me when I was in range or fell out but I don't think that's possible as this seems to be very simple. The feedback card enclosed with the product goes to an email address that isn't even this company, so there's something off about that."
263,Sigfredo valdes,"I recently lost my fitbit, and decided I wanted to replace it with a less expensive fitness watch. During my research, I came across the fitpolo smart watch, and decided I wanted to try it out. The watch is very similar to Apple I watch in terms of appearance and the software is comparable to Fitbit in terms of function. It has heart rate monitor, exercise app, steps, calories, stairs, even has sleep! Well first of all on the listing it said the battery life was like 3 days. Mine lasted almost 7 days.. Heart rate monitor works fine, i took it for a run and it recorded my data which is nice. You can control your phones music from the watch but it only allows you to skip to next song and pause/play. The timer lets you go as low as you want, which is great for interval training. I like that it throws in the pedometer. Interface is good enough. Overall, this watch represents an incredible value for the money.        372 people found this helpful"

The screen is scratched and dinged from my normal use, working around livestock and small animals. It also gets a little buggy now and then because I got it a little wet. It was a good buy to see if I actually liked having a smart watch. The timer function is really nice, I've been using it to set study goals for myself. "
266,Amazon Customer,"Bought this over a month ago and am highly impressed. I have small wrists and was worried it would look too big on my arm but it doesn't. It's about the same size as an apple watch and does everything I need for a fraction of the price. I only change this once a week and workout 5 times a week, keep it on while I sleep and everything and the battery lasts forever, especially if you keep the brightness down it'll go even longer. It tracks everything I need, resting heart rate, sleep, workouts, text messages, email notifications, calls, steps, even has find my phone which is helpful and you can set alarms to vibrate so you don't wake your partner. The only thing is the mile tracker isn't extremely accurate, it counts about .90 for every 1 mile, but I always have my phone with me while I run anyways so I track the actual distance with the Map My Run app. Otherwise this watch has blown me away for being under $40!    11 people found this helpful"

269,Michael Meade,"I went from an iPhone to Android phone and iWatch to this watch and am happy. So far so good for the price and function I am happy and would recommend. It was easy to setup and feels cheaper than my iWatch but it is and should feel that way. I wear my watch all the time so time will tell how it holds up and I will update. I did a workout yesterday and I found it easier to launch the workout mode than on my iWatch. Less confusing all you have to do is swipe left, right, up or down. Then to end the workout press the button on the watch. My company uses a point system and the APP you have to install ""VeryFitPro"" syncs to Google Fit (on the Android) and that syncs to my companies APP called Vitality. As you can tell all good and happy customer here now. "

Its barely noticeable, I just don't like the feeling that it could possibly be watching me. But other than that it works pretty good.  One person found this helpful"
271,Romina S.,Good for the price!
272,Lorita Kinman-Agarrat,"I haven’t explored all of the features yet, but so far it’s been great. Battery life surpasses my Apple Watch. It can go 3-5 days before needing a charge vs having to charge my Apple Watch every night. I’m sure it has something to do with how many functions are being utilized but still. We’ll see how long it will last."
273,Kinisha,"Does what it's supposed to do. Only thing I don't like about this watch is that it doesn't have more faces (dial faces). When I looked at the pictures, I thought I saw the time being the same color, but the hour and the colon is a mint blue color while the minute is white. I would like for the them to be both the same color. Other than that, the watch is good for the price. "
274,little_miss_sara,"Love this watch! It tracks my steps and sleep. I've had it a little over a month and have only had to charge it twice. I work in a kitchen, and my hands are constantly in water and I've had no problems with it. It's a great watch and for the price you can't beat it. One person found this helpful"

276,Patricia,"The watch itself is great, but the software stinks. After my 3rd (each 250$+) fitbit in 2 years, I went with amazfit from amazon. LOVE the watch AND the software AND the price. Fitbit you screwed up one too many times…."
277,EM,"I like my watch lot. I had it for a long time and i can tell I'm very pleased with it.i had it on me all the time, is water resistant (shower with it) and the battery is amazing. The functions are simple to see how much you walk, sleeps and heartbeat and few others. Everything is downloaded on my cellphone to look. Is for simple things if you want lots of things maybe this is not for you. For me is Perfect. "
278,nina,I really like it works very well. Not as smart as a smart watch but pretty close love it
279,Best Reviews,"Want a Smart Watch style watch without the cost of a full featured smart watch? This thing has the best bang for your buck. The features are OK, not a true smart watch but people mistake it for one all the time and are blown away at the low price I payed for it.  I mainly purchased this watch because I couldn't find a traditionally styled watch for the same price with a good alarm function. On this watch I have 10 very customizable alarms set for my work. You are able to set alarms for only certain days of each week which is exactly what I needed. The only pain is you must download and use their app with your smartphone to set your alarms and for the fitness features as well as other settings.  Pros: - cost (no need to worry about losing or scratching) - long battery life. (Lasts weeks for me) -10 alarms (customizable like a smartphone) - sms push notifications (read only) -lightweight and comfortable  Cons: -must use the app for most settings -strap retainer doesn’t stay in place -limited watch face skins (only 4) 25 people found this helpful"
280,Cookj,"If you want a bang for your buck this watch is the way to go.  Pros: Very easy to use. Took 3 seconds to sync if that. You can control alarms, timers, etc right from app. User friendly, not as complicated as the expensive devices yet does the job Nice ability to control your music using spotify (among a few others) Sleep monitor works great Walking and running feature shows calories burned which is nice right on the watch Came fully charged Easy to read manual, though it's not much needed Nice silicone-like wrist band  Cons: Charger is product specific... Will not work with micro usb basics. Do not get text message alerts  Overall I recommend this over the more expensive ones if your looking for the basics.                    6 people found this helpful"

282,Josh O.,"Seems to work well, unsure of how accurate it really is seems like its pretty automated and the battery on mine dies incredibly fast even when.i take.it off the charger it starts at 91% and have to charge every 2 or 3 days on the lowest minimum settings my wifes holds charge all week though"
283,Ana C,"This is the third watch I buy (I discover they have a lifespan of about a year before they go haywire but I figure for 30 bucks it’s a good investment. This last purchase however doesn’t track my sleep, which is one of the most important features to me. Every once in an while it does (without adjusting anything), and then it stops doing it for a week or more."
284,Valerie & Julius Navikas,"As soon as you connect your phone to the watch it will only count your steps if you have your phone with you.  However, I've recently learned that if it isn't connected to your phone then it will count your steps without your phone having to be on you at all times, but the downside to that is you wont get notifications such as texts and calls.  Battery life is exceptional and lasts all week on one charge"
285,Bargain Shopper,Love this watch! Pros: battery lasts for weeks! I love the walking and running option as well as the button that calls my phone to find it even if the ringer is off. Cons: Only four watch faces and I only like one of them. Most of the other watches on Amazon have a hundred options.
286,Barbara A. Warden,"It did not track my steps accurately. My iPhone tracked them better. Unfortunately, I did not realize this until after my return window had closed but the manufacturer gave me a full refund."
287,C. Boettcher,The battery life was too short and it had to be taken off the wrist to be charged. It kept up with my sleep very well but the battery would tend to run low while I was asleep and I would have to go through a whole charging session with synchronizing the watch to the app again.
288,Debbie,"This really tracks well when actively walking out working out but just regular walking doesn't track so well. In a day where I'm not taking a walk it tracks about 1/3 of steps I take. Having said that for the price it is a good value. It is water proof, I like that. One person found this helpful"
289,Melissa K,"I’ve been using this watch for a few months now while working out and the heart rate/bpm and cals burned are consistently inaccurate. I downloaded the app to set my age, weight, etc. thinking that might affect things but it didn’t. Overall I would not recommend this product. Probably best to save up and purchase a Fitbit or more reliable smartwatch."
290,Tan tan,"The battery lasts me up to 5 days or even longer. It stays connected with my phone, supper easy to connected as well, I'm in love with it."
291,R.Short,This was replacement for one my husband broke
292,TAnderson,The app is too complicated and so is the watch. The touch screen doesn't always work. I want to see how many steps I walked I have to look at app as can't find it on watch.cant get manual heart rate if you have it set at auto. Had other watched which were much more used friendly and gave better info.
293,CES,"i used to have an apple watch but tbh it was expensive and i was paying for the service, i feel like it was a waste if i didnt have service on it because it was an apple watch. i got rid of it and later wanted a watch just for fitness which this watch is perfect for. counts steps, has workout trackers for hiking, running , swimming etc. tracks ur sleep, the only thing i dislike is that i wake up always around 3am for a while until i go back to sleep and it cuts off my sleep when i wake up, so itll track 5 hrs when in reality i slept more. idk if there is a way to change that :/ but i love this watch it motivates me to workout and thats exactly what i wanted. 2 people found this helpful"
294,Arik Y.,Nice simple watch (no built in GPS) but about a month of use and the screen went not responding on and off and display is showing in mirror view on and off 
295,Spellbound,"I was pretty impressed with the Very Fit Pro and all it's options it has. I was really impressed with how it is able to tell the difference between deep restful sleep and light sleep and even showed a chart over the night which you find with the mobile app. I was also really surprised by the battery life, used it for 3 full days before it needs a charge! And it even has a menstrual cycle monitor with a reminder to set before it hits again, even included an ovulation monitor too if you want to be aware of those details. Plus it allows you to see music control, text messages and calls coming in. Very pleased with this purchase!!!  One person found this helpful"
296,Meg March,"This is about a half a mile less accurate than my GPS tracking. It says in the description that it uses GPS, but it doesn't. The charger magnets are already rusty, just from my sweat, I think. I did go swimming with it and it worked fine afterwards. The light pink band is dirty and I have not been able to find a way to clean it, so I feel a little bit like I don't want to wear it in public because it is so dirty. Overall I am happy with it, especially because of the price point. I don't see the point of getting a more expensive tracker unless you really need the accuracy of GPS. "
297,C. Balcirak,"Color: PINKVerified Purchase Bought this for my daughter. She wanted an ""iphone watch like her brothers"". Didn't want to spend that much money, especially since I wasn't sure how well she would take care of it. Fortunately this watch is holding up very well. I'm impressed. Even my son (who has an actual ""iphone watch"") is impressed with this watch. I haven't tried all the features, but so far my daughter loves it. and the battery life is very good."
298,Lorraine Powell,"After my Misfit Path broke I was looking to replace it and found this one on line. I like it very much. It took me a while to get it all synchronized and about 2 days to get everything working. So far so good. I've been taking it off to shower even though it says it is waterproof and I think it counts more steps than I actually do. I've been comparing it with another app I have on my phone which records less steps than this new smartwatch. Otherwise I love it. The sleep app on it is very accurate and the alarm is consistent. If you are looking to jump into the smartwatch fad, thean I recommend it for it's inexpensive cost compared to other types out there."
299,TXN GRL,Works great! And looks awesome. I met someone with a very similar Apple Watch but mine actually looked better!
300,Dayna Turner,"It wouldn’t let me upload my video for some reason, but this watch has worked fine for me, I know the reviews are all over the place but I’ve had no problems with the watch I’ve had it for 10 days and it works just fine. I use it to track my steps, my workouts and my sleep."
301,Victoria E. Jones,Excellent product and very attractive.
302,Beverly,Received as a Christmas gift. Very satisfied with it.
303,Sara EV,"Some time ago I wanted a fitness watch and I decided on this one, I only charge it when I arrive and so far I have not had to charge it again, I like its design and size, it is comfortable for the wrist and almost doesn't weigh; I was a little afraid that the watch would be damaged when I took a shower, but it's perfect! It is excellent for its quality / price compared to other watches, it fulfills all its functions and I have not had any problems with it."
304,holsey x bennett,"Heart rate,sleep tracking, exercise activity.."
305,Eileen Lupo,This watch was very easy to pick out because it looked like it had all the features I could ask for and more! It was super cheap especially for what you are getting. I love how quick and easy all the features are with just four simple swipes. You can easily see your heart rate as well as the number of steps you have taken. It's helpful to also see how many active calories you have burned throughout the day as well as the number of resting calories burned during the day. Another great feature is the ability to set an alarm with the app and set a timer for a relaxing mode. I use the sport mode every day which is probably my favorite because I can keep track of the amount of activity I do every day. Definitely recommend this watch it has helped me keep track of my physical health as well as my mental health. 
306,bndjohn,Second one I have had. First one lasted 2 years before wearing out. The pink band is awful impossible to keep clean and dulling after two weeks. Sleep tracker only shows partial data in the mornings but updates later in the day. Settings could be made more user friendly. One person found this helpful

311,Lexxii,Whatever the manufacturer uses for the plastic and watch causes my skin to break out and redden. Works nice though. Need to charge every day to ensure notifications come on the watch
312,Amazon Customer,I found it a bit difficult to set up. It was difficult to read as the numbers were so small for my older eyes. Just not impressed with this watch.
313,Kelly,"I've had this watch for two months now and have used it every day. I've only charged it twice so far! I only really use it for heart rate, to track steps, and alarms but it has a lot of really cool features! I was unsure about buying because the price was so low, but honestly it seems just like an apple watch without being able to return texts on the watch. It's motivated me to walk 4 miles every day and keep walking at the end of the day until I hit my 10,000 steps! It's a great motivator to be able to really count what work you're doing and the little buzz the watch does when you hit 10,000 steps feels great!"
314,J. E. S.,"For what’s just a fraction of the price that the big brands charge, this is a really solid smart watch. I use it in weightlifting to time my rest periods and check on my heart rate from time to time. The heart rate seems accurate and the timer function is much easier to use than fumbling with a phone. The battery lasts for a very long time and the strap is comfortable, so it’s a convenient thing to just pick up and out on before hitting the gym. I also found customer service to be very responsive to any questions that I had, which is not something I’ve always experienced with other manufacturers. As long as you’re not expecting all of the smooth functionality of watches multiple times as expensive, I think you’ll be happy with this one. "
315,Angela,"I have been wearing this watch since I got it a few days ago. It seems to have a good battery life, I get messages from my smart phone right away and it tracks my sleep, steps and heart rate. I am very happy with my new watch It was the best purchase of a smart watch I could buy. very happy."
316,Kelly N.,
317,alabee,"I bought this watch to track my sleep because I’ve been waking up in the night. The watch/app didn’t track that I was awake for a full hour last night- I’m fact it said I was in deep sleep for the times I was awake. the watch was confusing for me to setup, the instructions aren’t very clear. The app just isn’t good."
318,aurora alfaro,"I have bought many watches like this in the past and all of them ended dead after getting in the pool, touch rain etc this one has past the test so far, great look, battery last many days , compatible with iPhone ! "
319,D.G. Christy,"This fitness tracker is a good value for the money. However the accuracy could be better. For instance, it tracks about 800 steps fewer than the Apple app on my phone. Now, who's to say Apple app is that accurate? As a result, the mileage on runs and walks naturally tracks less on the watch and app in comparison to the Apple app. The GPS tracking is right on the money though.  It picks up phone calls, and calendar but the SMS messenger does not work (possible operator error here).  Bottom line, this watch is a good value for the money."
320,Tito,"Smart Watch cumple con lo que se describe, durabilidad de batería, material ligero.  Por el momento todo bien..    Helpful"
321,girlygirl77,Was skeptical about the item but the tracking ability is pretty reliable. Used Fitbit for months with very inaccurate calories burned daily but this item tracks it all very well. It's a 4.5 star for me.
322,Denise,"I like the watch but...... It's not like my other watch I have, it didn't have info of the weather and the heart monitor doesn't detect most of the time when I move. Having troubles hooking up to Bluetooth it says connected but doesnt show up on my phone. Other than those issues it's a good watch for the price."
323,Leticia Neria,"I have had this watch for some months now, and it was a great purchase. It is not very accurate but it helps me to have an idea about how much I'm walking, calories burned, and if I need to move a little bit more. I have an app in my mobile to track distances and the difference is not small (not very big, though), but, for what I paid, it does the trick ;-) 2 people found this helpful"

Somehow I guess I thought the 2nd production release was going to actually work, which it does not.  The sync function does not meld, the app isn't friendly with all phones & the charger disengages if the wind blows, with you none the wiser."
327,DeAnn M,I dislike the instructions to me not very clear. I had so many question. There is a number for you to call. My schedule was very busy so I had to play around with it for about a week on my own. Work great with my water aerobics class. You have to use the workout button for almost everything. You have to guess what the small icons on one screen represent. I hate that when I go to sleep and wake up for awhile the sleep mode doesn't register my next sleep time. Also I notice my workout time doesn't register my steps while working out. Now that's all the bad. The good... Once you learn the watch it is a great watch and tracker. Large screen. Download my information to my phone quickly. I turn on my bluetooth after each workout and then turn off. I recommend this fitpolo for anyone looking for a good product and low price.

I have gone more than 7 days without charging the phone. I originally bought this watch to help me with my fitness journey but it has helped improved my work routine as well. This watch helps me relax when stressed at work, reminds me to get up and move, and also reminds me of important meetings I have scheduled for the day. Any issues you many have with the watch the support team is fast and efficient with answering. Will definitely be getting another watch soon! "
334,Kelly K,"The watch itself is great, especially for the price. However, I have only worn it for a little over 2 weeks and the pink band has already faded. I just had to order a 2 pack of replacement bands (black and blue) to replace this pink one. That was another $15.00. So although the watch was a good price, it does have added cost if you order the pink one and have to buy new watch bands. But I do love the watch itself. "
335,Maritza Montero Martinez,"Para regalo de padres,espero salga bueno Helpful"
336,Stasi,"I’m cursing this watch for getting me hooked on smartwatches and now I just spent a ton on an Apple Watch. Would have been happy if this watch had worked out - the corner notch that holds the band’s pin broke off randomly while I was wearing it. I’m grateful it was still within the return window. Would have exchanged for a new one if I wasn’t worried same thing would happen again, but I guess you get what you pay for. Loved the heart rate/sleep tracking and vibrating wrist alarms….. "

339,Suzski,"I purchased this same watch about 4 years ago and it worked fine. I was able to set my goals for walking and sleep. But on this new watch, my second, it will not let me set my goals. It tracks my steps based on 10,000 and my sleep starting at midnight. No way to change it. Sometimes it tells me my heart rate and sometimes not. If feel like it is missing a chip or something. I'm saving up for a Samsung watch. Will not order this one again. It does keep time if that's all you want it for and the battery life is good."

My phone rang and it was found thanks to the Fitpolo. Battery life seems good. Took it out of the package with 89% charge, set it up and have used it for eight hrs and it's still at 89%. Not to sure how accurate the active mod is yet but so far with how everything else has worked on it I believe it will be just fine. Also comes with a one year extended warranty.

344,Krista,"I absolutely loved this watch at first. It's great quality, thr battery life is outstanding, however, now that its getting nice outside and im walking more im noticing its not very accurate. My phone that I dont always carry tends to have almost 2,000 more steps recorded than my watch. If I set the walk feature it doesn't apply those steps to my daily count which then goes into my weekly summery. If I take a nap or tey to get extra rest that doesn't get recorded, only the night stretch of sleep. Im noticing more and more lately it disconnects from Bluetooth on its own as well. I still wear it regardless because I like that I can get alerts for messages and calls but im sad that im going to have to invest in a new watch for better accuracy. 2 people found this helpful"

But that has been an bout a 48hr or the 8 days. Battery is at 23%. The accuracy of the hr monitor I feel is a little off compared to my old fitbit. Features wise it is like an Fitbit hr 2-3 with better graphics. I cant quite figure out why I dont get texts to it but that is not why I bought it. I bought it as a watch for the kids They always want a smart watch even thought they dont have phones. This will help them teach their activitie and get them more exercise while home schooling. Over all supper happy for the price. 2 people found this helpful
348,C. O.,"The watch seems to work very well when it comes to the Heart Rate and Sleeping, however, it is falling short (very short) on the accuracy of steps. The reason I bought the watch was because I didn't think my Samsung watch was accurate with the amount of steps, feeling it was shorting a good number of them. However, this watch falls well behind my Samsung in the step counts and misses a lot of steps. But it is easy to use and does a good job tracking my sleep and heart rate. Wanted something that tracked my sleep well and didn't need to be charged overnight.  3 people found this helpful"

I use the walk feature when walking my dogs & it helps me stay on track with my fitness goals. I ordered a pink one, but received a black one, but it was totally fine with me. No big deal. "

354,TechMama,"Color: BLACKVerified Purchase I got one of these types of watches for my son and he loves it so much our nephew wanted a similar one. This has great fitness features and the cousins compete on step counting and fitness goals. The app is great because you can see how much REM sleep they are actually getting a night, and adjust it so texts and calls do not go to the watch. The battery life is insane! It seems to last for weeks. He loves even being able to know the date easily and does extra things around the house just to get more steps in. Definitely a great investment in one's health.  3 people found this helpful"

You can't get better for the price. I am getting another one for my husband!"
356,J.J.H,"Not impressed with this watch or the app. Some nights it records no sleep at all and when it does the time is never correct. And I don’t think the step count is accurate either. I bought this watch to wear at work so I would not destroy my other watch that matches my phone. But if I wear my good watch by accident and go about my day and every day I cover the about the steps the discrepancy between the two are huge. So I can’t have faith in any info recorded what good is it? It does communicate with my phone to alert me of texts and calls and does tell time , so it’s not completely worthless I guess. The choice of watch faces is also very limited and the app leaves a lot to be desired. Not impressed and would not recommend. The pic is after 8.5 hours of sleep, nothing recorded!

357,Gadgetperson,Tried it with the hope of getting away from Fitbit which has quality issues. The pedometer/step counter of this device is very inaccurate. I tried it with other pedometers and the step count with this device was about 50% of what it should be. That is a non starter for me. I put it aside and should have returned it months ago but simply forget. The return window ended months ago. I'll put it in a drawer and forget it or just throw it away. A good looking piece of junk.

You can control your phones music from the watch. Overall, this watch it very good   "
360,Oana V.,"I wanted to wait 3 full months before leaving a review to make sure the products has efficiency and durability. With that said, this watch has blown me away. It’s my 6th try on a fitness watch that can track well and not use other movements such as typing or hand motions as trackable steps. It even tracks treadmill steps if you choose that option which is so great. Solid buy, no complaints and for the price, I really can’t believe it. Also the battery lasts a full week if I use the treadmill option and about 2 weeks if I don’t. that was a pleasant surprise too."

It’s super easy to start using it. After downloading the “Very fit pro” app, and entering all your information you can bring to take advantage of this watches many features. The most valuable, in my opinion, is that The Heart Rate monitor and Sleep monitoring. It will track your heart rate for 24 hours,very important for everyone with a heart condition. It support tons of sports modes and you can receive phone call and sms alert ."
364,skoobie,"To start, I've had 2 different fitbits... They were nice but I saw how many non Fitbit brands there were and wondered if they worked equally as well for a a fourth of the price. I purchased this watch and happy to say it has all of the features and works equally as well as either of my fitbits. It has all of the features that I need and have come to expect from higher end fitness watches. I love this watch and I'm so happy that I purchased it instead of the higher end brand... This saved me so much money! 5 people found this helpful"
365,Tori Kittell,"I have looked at many different fitness trackers, but will have to say this is by far one of the coolest ones yet. For women it is really great having that mensuratal cycle tracker so we have a good idea of when it will happen. To being able to locate your lost phone. Granted I could go on and on about some of the great qualities of this watch, but I will some it up by saying. This watch not only is it water proof (yes I tested it by taking a shower with it on....) It also provides a detail of tracking for your heart/sleep/steps/and sport activity. This is definitely a watch to be looking into getting. Bonus I absolutely love the color I chose too! "
366,Erica,Just wanted something simple to track steps and sleep and notify me of calls. Battery lasts a long time-about a whole week. Pedometer seems accurate. The sleep tracker doesn't always work correctly. It tends to track every other night. Oh I have irritation from the band.
367,Zeinub Alber,Definitely love this watch! It has all the functions of a much more expensive fitness tracker at a much more affordable price. Overall the band is comfortable for all-day wear and the face illuminates when turned towards your face. Connectivity to my phone was a breeze and the app is easy to use. I gave 4 stars because not all of the watch face options show the date.
368,HUNTL,"I'm not a gadget person. All I wanted was an automated way to track my steps. This watch supplies that and much more without the hefty price tag. I've compared it against my husband's expensive brand, and for the functions needed to maintain an active lifestyle this watch has it. One recommendation: all of the exercise categories are represented except elliptical. It would be great if a software upgrade could include elliptical in the sport tracking mode."

373,Gail Moore,"As I was setting up the watch the instructions required a credit card and emphasized this was only for future purchases, nothing would be charged now. Within 5 minutes I received a fraud alert from my bank saying $39.95 was charged to my account, by this company. I brought this watch because it was marked with ""Amazon Choice."" I called the company but was only connected to an answering service which works for several companies, and they were no help at all. I called Amazon and they offered a refund after I return the watch. Apparently Amazon's Choice means nothing at all. Buyer beware! 3 people found this helpful"

However I think I'll be sticking to this one. The screen face is a great size, it's bright and clear and the touch screen aspect is flawless. It's wrist turning sensor actually works better than my Fitbit did. While it doesn't have quite as many personalization options I am pleased with the options it does provide. It seems to have as accurate of a step counter as the Fitbit as well. The band is sturdy and comfortable. The watch synchs effortlessly with the app on the phone. I have zero complaints.

382,Lexus,"It serves it's purpose as a fitness tracker but the added bells and whistles are unreliable. It doesn't stay in sync with phone control functions such as find my phone, music player and text alerts. Once I really needed the find my phone function only for it to read Bluetooth disconnected. I tried rebooting the device, unbinding and binding again and leaving the app running in the background but nope those features fail to remain an option. It read my sleep wrong once while trying to get features to work. It's an okay fitness tracker but you can find a simple tracker cheaper and get the same results as the phone control features are too unreliable. 2 people found this helpful"

Are the steps accurate? Not all the time due to the 30 count delay they have built into the watch for chores. So if I find myself wanting a more accurate step count I just put on the walking sport mode. For $35.99 I'm not complaining one bit, even the band fits nice. One person found this helpful"

390,AV,"I recently purchased a series 5 Apple Watch and my 14 year old daughter has expressed the need for one for herself. Reluctant to spend that much on a watch for a 14 year old, I started searching amazon for one that would best suit her needs. She’s very active, watches her steps every single day and loves listening to music. Upon reading the reviews on this watch, I was satisfied enough to try it out. She’s had it know for a week and I’m extremely impressed! She uses all the workout modes, steps, calories, music, messaging... basically everything that my $400 watch does. Her battery lasted 5 days before needing to charge again. Now my husband is jealous of her watch, so I’m patiently waiting for another lightening deal to purchase him one as well! 77 people found this helpful"
391,Texas Customer,"Thought this watch would at least be different than the other fit ones. However, its a bit worse. After having it charged; setting it up with the app took a bit since it wasn't pairing. Also, getting a sleep reading wasnt working the first time wearing, and would only work once in a while. Then to top it off, I kept getting skin irritation from wearing it more than a day or two. Bought another band that helped for a bit, then I got the skin irritation from the underside of the watch face. Now it doesn't even track the steps anymore. So, won't be wearing this watch after a short time of having it and would NOT recommend to anyone else."
392,CASSIDY,Had to return. Bought 2 for me and my partner and then steps are inaccurate. We went on a walk together and it counted him as over 200 more steps than me. Then later that day I can home and sat down on the couch while my partner walked around from room to room grabbing things he needed and moving them from room to room and it tracked me as 300 over him. Keep in mind this wasn't just a delayed tracking as it didn't ever eventually even out or anything. Him and I at different times throughout the day counted our steps to and from parts of the house and we would count 15 in our heads and the step would count me at 7 and him at 22.
393,Jennifer Moore,"So far I really like the fitness tracker. It doesn’t monitor sleep but that’s ok. I wore my tracker yesterday for the first time and I feel like it was great. It tracked my activity, user friendly, even though there’s a slight learning curve because I’ve had Fitbit for years. But I was able to learn it quickly and it’s very comfortable. I think it’s a great value and I like the app it’s also user friendly too. Other than not tracking sleep, and the print is very small (if I don’t have my glasses on I can’t see the tiny print) but other than that I am very Satisfied with it! Also they have really great customer service I really like that tooooo! Very happy with it 😊 2 people found this helpful"

After 12 days of its usage, I felt like I took a good decision in buying this fitpolo smart watch. It has almost all the essential functionality that expensive fitbit and Apple smart watches have. All the functionality like Activity tracking, sleep, heart beat, notifications works perfectly. Battery life is Amazing! After using it for 12 days also still 36% battery charge is there.It works fine in controlling the music playing in the phone and able to see all the text and whatsapp messages from the watch itself.Overall this watch represents an incredible value for the money.

I came upon this watch which works smoothly for me and met my expectations while it offers some good additional features, like sleep tracking, call alert and women health tracking. If you don't need anything fancy I definitely would recommend this tracker, and the battery life lasts about a week or so. The call alert is a bit delayed with the bluetooth but it works and I won't ask for more since it's so cheap lol. "
414,ST89,I was interested in buying myself a fitness tracker but was hesitant on buying an expensive one in case u stopped wearing it a few months later.

It even has a setting where you can locate your misplaced phone!

The GPS mileage is slightly off but not by much say 100metres or so, so that is acceptable. Great watch is my conclusion!     "
425,CJ,The watch does what I need and has a nice bright display that I can see outside in the sun. I compared the walking tracker with my UA Map My Walk and it is accurate to that comparison.

The bands can't accurately track steps, heart rate, location, or sleep, let alone anything else. The app is about as helpful as a headache and customer support was non-existent. I am returning both immediately and purchasing something from a reputable company that stands behind the product they sell."

What I liked it is that the app was easy to install and sync on my smartphone, and the battery is really good. It monitors my heart rate and even my sleep quality during night. The main reason for buying this fitness tracker is to track my steps, calories burned and distance during the day and also track the week work done and so far I love it. Also has an option of relax that allows you to stop you from your busy routine for 1 or 2 min, it is pretty nice!     4 people found this helpful"

430,Adam Wilson,"I am blown away by just how horrible this thing is. I think the manufacturer must be experimenting with how to design a watch minus the functions any reasonable consumer would expect it to have. Imagine buying a television, but in order to hear any sound, you have to download an phone app and listen to it through your phone. The watch DOES NOT DISPLAY STEPS. This is borderline false advertising, because the product is described as a pedometer.  This watch is an absolute waste. Mine's on the way to a landfill. 2 people found this helpful"

Even keeps up with your heart rate and alarms!

Actually tracked my sleep pretty well too. The strap is HUGE. I have it on the 4th smallest hole and have so much strap hanging and gets caught. I’m probably going to cut off the extra. Only problem I have is it doesn’t have a sport select for horse back riding so when I ride it counts it as my step count. I hit 10,000 steps by 11 today because I rode my horse for an hour. Wish it had a sport setting for riding."

I received the item in less than 48 hrs and now my husband is asking for one :) I ordered the watch for weight-loss purposes but I love being able to read my text messages when I'm not near my phone. I would have provided an overall rating of 5 but I wish they offered more 3-party sync options.
439,linda thompson,I love my watch so far. The colors are vibrant and the numbers are large so at a quick glance I can tell the time. I have a small wrist but the watch size totally works for me. I was worried that the band might be cheaply made plastic but it is well made and conforms nicely to my wrists. I have had no trouble pairing with my Android phone and love being able to track my workouts and also get text messages. I have wanted a smart watch for a long time but could not justify spending money on an Apple Watch. So glad that I decided to get this watch. My biggest problem is going to be keeping my daughter from trying to wear it.
440,Griffin Carlson,"Very inaccurate at counting miles or steps, for every 12 steps, usually about 16 are counted, the step tracker on my phone is significantly more accurate. It usually doesn't track your heart rate during a workout unless you use the Sport feature. While using the workout feature, you can't set a timer for your breaks on the watch. Additionally the timer is unintuitive and takes a lot of time to scroll through each minute or second one at a time. Not a clue how it tracks calories, nor if it is accurate or not. Music controller does not show song name/author and the left of the apps on the watch is non-customizable. There are only 4 options for your dial and none of them are particularly great, as well as it cannot be set to view any specific info on your dial. One person found this helpful"

I have this watch for 1 week and the battery still reaches 50 percent, which seems to be able to survive for 2 weeks until the battery is empty.  Pros: Lightweight Precise readings Bright Screen Band of soft materials Very simple to use Quite easy to synchronize  The fitness tracker is generally very compact, simple to use and a precise device that I would certainly recommend unless you have deep pockets for high-end smartwatches:).

Functionality wise I can't fault it, Scrolls pretty smoothly between screens and had lots of features including, Email, SMS, call, WhatsApp alerts, alarms, music app control, date and time, fitness tracking for various activities, heart rate monitor.

But this tracker misses most of my steps when I am shopping pushing a cart such as at the grocery store or any other cart where my arms are stationary. It would not work for someone pushing a baby stroller while trying to get exercise. I first noticed that my steps when shopping seemed undercounted so I tested it and it failed to count them. It seemed to only count those steps when I was away from the cart and not those where I was walking down aisles. 2 people found this helpful

457,Lynnette,The biggest reason I gave it 3 stars is that I woke up with a rash on my arm where it touches the skin. I switched arms with the same result. It was very disappointing as the band was so soft and more pliable than bands on other products I've used.

463,Amazon Customer,"I had difficulty pairing my first purchase. I tried ""live chat"" on website and received no response. I decided it was faulty and requested a replacement. After that arrived, I had the same issue. This time, however, Sharon in customer service responded to my request for help on the Support portion of the website. She determined that I needed to download the VertFitPro app instead of the Fitpolo app. Pairing went well and I'm very happy with the product. Great value!

I already own a metal, blingy Huawei, and a diamond Rolex, but needed an everyday knock around smartwatch I could sweat in while hiking, biking, and working out. Hiked three miles today and then jumped in the pool. It's waterproof! The color is a soft blush with rose gold metal, so it's quite neutral. I was afraid it would look too large, but it's not, and for reference, I'm 5'7"" with an average frame. Such a fantastic value! It's perfect! "

484,Meli,"The first couple months were great, I loved using it at the gym because I was able to control music from my wrist and I didn't have to pull out my phone to change the song.  Then I started noticing everything was off, from the sleep tracking, how many steps I was doing, and the heart rate. I figured I could put all those aside since the main reason I got it was for music control. But then the fourth month, a BRIGHT RED LINE started to appear on the left side of the watch. It is a bit of an eye sore and I can't stand looking at it.  Just do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive watch!!!!!!"
485,Alfa Catilo,"It’s my first time to buy a smart watch and this is a great choice! It’s very easy to set up, synch with your phone and the key features that I need is available.

I pulled too hard one day and everything bent and was no longer useable. The battery life is much longer than other watches I have used,"
490,Miriam Maaravi,"I got my FitPro two days ago. The watch is nice for a low budget fitness tracker and the app is pretty user friendly. I had no problems getting set up and started.  I don't like that the watch face doesn't display the date. It would also be nice to see the daily step count on the watch face.  The light color pink watch band is a dirt magnet and gets an unsightly, grayish tinge with normal wear.  I don't know yet how accurate or durable the watch is, so I'm waiting to see what happens."

499,Uniman#1,"It serves its purpose as a WATCH. Nut, the VeryFitPro mobile app is BAD! For example, if you open an Amazon link in Facebook, the VeryFitPro app “intercepts” the link and opens VeryFitPro (and NOT Amazon). Very annoying. I tried changes to the setting, but nothing works. I took the app out, and the Amazon links work. As soon as I reinstall VeryFitPro, it does it again and intercepts opening Amazon (from Facebook). GPS, steps, miles, cycling, hiking… are all spotty and inaccurate. Again, it serves it’s purpose as a watch (a “pseudo-Apple"" watch)🤣🤣🤣 Warning: Do NOT install VeryFitPro mobile app."
500,Anoyek H.,This was purchased for a 10 year old boy. He loves it and wears it often. He did have to stop wearing it for a week because the back of the watch that sits on his wrist started to cause a rash. I think it'e because he would only take it off to shower. He loves it and really likes that he only has to charge it possibly twice a week.

The ones before didn't record heart rate, the battery only lasted a few days and the cheap wrist band broke after the return time was up."

The watch is still pretty cool and I still like the functions it has but I don't want to end up with these bumps if I wear it again. "
505,Amy,The primary reason for purchasing the watch was to track my steps. It doesn’t register steps accurately- not even close. I can asked on the treadmill for 5 miles. When I compared the watch to both my pedometer worn on the waist as well as the treadmill distance it was extremely off read not even close.  I like the watch face size and the band comfort.  I returned.  I had also purchased a second for my husband. Same disappointment with it with counting steps. Both were returned. One person found this helpful

507,A Wilkens,This watch is great for the money! The app that it uses could be a little more user friendy but I emailed customer service for the watch and they are very informative and responsive. It is comfortable and seems accurate. So far I am wearing it for 3 days and haven't had to charge it. it's at about 50%. The sleep tracker is crazy accurate it seems. 
508,Jennifer,"I bought this tracker to replace my Fitbit that had stopped charging. If all you want is a watch that tracks your steps, this will work fine for you. I have it set-up to alert me to phone calls or messages but that has only worked a couple of times. It requires me to shut down the watch & restart my phone and even then, those alerts have never worked for more than a couple of hours. The heart rate & sleep monitor stopped tracking after the first week and have never started working again. I've tried all of the trouble shooting recommendations but none get those features to work consistently. I knew that for $35 I wasn't going to be getting a top of the line fitness tracker but I did hope it would be better than this."

I ended up figuring out what was wrong but imagine if I had to return or replace it? Seller would of probably ignored me! Never got an email replied 😡! No problems with watch though! Good battery life and works as it should now!

Another additional good feature that I liked is the ability to control music directly from watch which avoid taking phone out and I can enjoy my playlist the way I want.

SLEEP TRACKER CLOSE BUT OFTEN MISSES FULL SLEEP SCHEDULE 3. SCRATCHES EASY 4. EXERCISE FUNCTION GOES DARK AND RESETS 5. GREEN LIGHT SENSOR WILL BLINK ALL NIGHT IF YOU TAKE IT OFF SOMETIMES  I did buy it to count my steps at a cheap price. It does a really great job at that. However, it says it does so much more like heart rate, sleep, exercise, and more.  Sorry but the heart rate monitor is always wrong. The sleep counter is close but not accurate. The exercise option I never used because the screen would go dark and then my exercise would reset.  Also, the screen scratched a couple weeks in when I hit my wrist on some plastic in the car.  Sooooo for the money if you just want to count steps it's worth it. The mobile app does connect very well.

After downloading and installing FitPro's app that's where it went downhill. The phone recognizes my watch but the watch doesn't recognize the iphone. So, it will not notify me of any messages. It has 4 built in watch faces but I'm not crazy about them. The company video of the watch shows that there are multiple faces available using the app. They say to open the app and click on the ""more"" at the bottom of the screen except there is NO ""more"" at the bottom or anywhere on the app. I have everything turned on but unfortunately nothing works.

535,Brandy,"User manual is pathetic. Very small print and makes no sense at all. After a few pages, it states you have to charge it before you can do anything. Seems like that should have been on page one. Instructions for charging are strictly via pictures. Scanned the QR Code and read the Terms and Conditions to find that they will charge a fee any time they upgrade the software. If you don't agree to pay the fee, the watch no longer works correctly. Plus, they share customer information world-wide. Never did figure out how to change the incorrect time that was displayed. The wristband is designed for a very large wrist. I consider mine to be average circumference but, even in the tightest link, the watch slipped around my wrist and would not stay in place. Received the watch and packed it up as a return on the same day. It's true that you get what you pay for and this watch just isn't worth the investment. One person found this helpful"

565,Scubaski,"this watch and app is a POS. I went to sleep last night at 1230 AM. the app says 306 AM and I woke up at 630 AM. twice in the last week or so it says I walked almost 200,000 steps in one day. it did the same thing last month. you can't count on this giving accurate data."
566,Robin Estes,I've had this for 5 weeks. I swim daily. It's supposed to be water proof. However it no longer swipes to view calories burned etc. Very disappointing.
567,Jeannette Jones,Tracks my steps and has other great features such as the alarm and timer which I use all the time. If you have a music app you can control it thru the watch. The watch also has caller id. I have to charge every 3-4 days which is better than the last one I had.
568,Jill B.,"Overall considering the price, it’s not a bad purchase, but I couldn’t stand that it would take 2-3 seconds for the screen to light up after I’d turn my wrist. It seems small but when I just want to know the time it’s annoying to have to wait that long every time. I returned it, the process was really simple."

571,Bill H,"Use it for exercise, tracking steps, and heart rate"
572,Lulu,"So far the watch works as intended, it does tracks the sleep very well, a bit off on steps but again it tracks movement, so moving your hands too much will count as steps. It integrated well with the app, easy to use and update, lasts about 7 days on a full charge "
573,Katie M,"Honestly, why pay $300 or $600 for a smart watch when you can pay $35... tempted to purchase another to keep on hand just in case! Just got the watch and I’m obsessed! Super easy to download the app and get it synched to my phone. Seems to be losing charge quickly as it’s being set up so will keep on the charger and update. Love it though for the value so far, can’t wait to use it all day everyday!"

575,Hayden,"First 3 days I loved it, seemed to work great. 3rd night I wore it I woke up with a round rash/burn from the watch. Didnt wear it on the 4th night. 5th day i wore it on other wrist and it irritated that one. Also every so often it will flash 2 bright green lights where sensors are. Maybe that is what caused it. 🤔 Returning."

577,Momma2May&A,"Great little tracker and the price is nice. Besides tracking my steps and, sleep and heart, I love the find my phone option, the turn off the light & movement option, the do not disturb access button on the watch itself, change the face of the watch..and the alarm set up (its a gentle wake up rather than the radio or annoying beeps).

I was a little nervous about receiving text messages because I have an iPhone. It took me several attempts to get it to connect, but once I did, I can read my messages just fine. Love, love, love it!!"

581,Dina,I bought this one for my nice birthday but I wanted to try on me and it looks beautiful it is ligth weit and confortable to use I use with my phone and it works great the conetion is strong and I didn't feel it while I was sleeping. It has functions enough for a teenager she will love it. Best thin for he is that it has phone locator. 
582,Jeanyah Vuu, Normally I don’t usually wear a watch to sleep but actually it’s pretty handy. I wore my watch last night to see how it works and it did. I checked on my app tells me what time I sleep and wake up. Also they tell you a time of how deep sleep you are and light sleep. 2 people found this helpful

584,Joseph Kenworthy,"I needed a reasonably priced fitness watch, and this one scored a ten. The pulse rate monitor has always been within 5 beats of what my Dr records. The tracking monitor also works well. I always know how far I have walked, and the time it took me. All the features are nice and easy to use with the bluetooth technology"
585,Retired Lady,"Has more than I wanted! Just need to monitor steps and check heart rate! The correct time would be nice, since it's a big watch on my arm but the instructions don't give me a way to set the time correctly without signing up for an app that does more than I want! I can't monitor my steps without confusion since the time is set to China's time zone, and always shows a day and a half ahead of my correct time.! This is annoying! Other than that, it seems to be quality, exercising in the pool doesn't bother it (until it restarts the steps in the middle of my workout)! I've sent an email to the company but haven't heard back just yet (too soon).Update: company wrote back, said customers can’t reset the time without signing up for their app; Next time I’ll look for a simpler device.

587,rachellespenname,This is my first smart watch so I have nothing to compare it to. But I love this thing! I feel a bit spoiled and it was only $35! The pink is very subtle/muted. You just download the app and plug in your preferences and it's good to go. Comes with a little USB magnetic charger. Alerts you to emails and texts. The little booklet says to keep it dry so I can't speak to it's water-proofness.
588,Joctl2,"Obviously a very inexpensive sports watch, so expectations cannot be high. I wanted to be able to track steps and sleep quality. Number of steps are inaccurate as well as sleep, as it would not note times when I was awake, such as when I physically got out of bed. Aside from that, it is a decent watch for telling time and has a very long battery life."
589,Nitasha Mease,I bought this kind as well as one that has a color band. This one is mine. Love it. I love that I do not have to worry about water with this. The battery life last awhile. Great product! Worth the investment. I will never pay for a name brand one again!  I even got the extender bands via amazon and they said they fit Fitbit vers well they also fit this !
590,stephanie thomas,"I love this watch! I was wanting a Apple Watch but couldn’t see paying so much for it. Then saw this one that looks like one but is a fraction of the cost.

After about a half hour charging in the other room, I decided to check the app to see how I slept last night. Wouldn't you know it? The app was magically measuring my heart rate several feet away from the watch. I expected it to show nothing. But nahhhhhhh, it was measuring a heart rate as my phone was sitting on the kitchen counter. Because of this, I can't recommended this watch. "

596,C C,"I upgraded to this watch from the lowest- priced one. It is a breeze to charge, has a long battery life, and is easy to read with nice big numbers. I bought it to wear in the pool. I am hoping it really is water resistant. It looks expensive!"

610,Hozco,"The watch looks nice, But like most things from China they look like something and you find out the 3rd nothing. 1st off the manual is in 6 languages, I read and write 4 of those languages, None of them give you even remotely the information you need to get this watch to functioning. So it's fly by the seat of your pants to try and figure it out and very soon you find out things like you can't get your heart meter graft above a 120, If you want to reset anything you have to wait until midnight and it resets everything. The only things that are good about this is the size the comfort and the battery life. I should have known better with the price and the country of origin. PS it's really good at locating your phone also. However with that in mind I would like all the other functions to do what they say they do but they do but they don't. 9 people found this helpful"

I normally use 50 spf all over and the areas where my watch rested are severely burned and blistering. If you're using this watch for just regular use it's fine, but if you spend extended periods outside without the watch on please beware. "
634,Shortlady16,"This watch does not count steps even close to accurate. After going to both a local Walmart and a Home Depot it had only registered 1321 steps. As Amazon suggested, I reached out to the seller on a couple of occasions and got no response. Amazon also was not willing to help. If I could afford an Apple watch I would buy one. Granted I'm not expecting the same results as an Apple product, but this device is called an activity tracker and it unfortunately does not track activity correctly."

666,Leanna,I've been on a quest to get a new watch that isn't over $100 and this one is definitely not it. I walk a lot and this watch doesn't calculate that. I have the app running 24/7 on my phone. Draining my battery. Yet if I don't go into the app every 25ish minutes my steps don't get counted. I've walked many many steps just to look at the watch and it says I haven't been active for hours and am still at 12 steps since midnight. I tried to give it a week hoping it would adjust but all it's done is drive me crazy with it's not calculating.
667,CTS,"Love the look. Like the BPM tracking. Love the time. Love the fit. HATE THE STEP TRACKING... you know, the reason I bought this. Unfortunately, it does NOT track steps, it tracks all movements, including when I was sitting on the bed folding laundry. I don’t need something to inflate my ego, I need something to tell me how many steps I did in a day.  I will be keeping this watch as it’s cute, tells time & tells me my heart rate, but that I had to buy a second pedometer, an analog one, makes me mad.  I will say, if you have one of those “steps per day” competitions at work, this will be great as it will count more steps per day & you might actually win.     "

676,Morgan Dunn,"Okay, so I originally got this to figure out how many calories I burned each day so I could figure out my caloric deficit to lose weight. I liked it, it was cute, however the calories burned is not accurate AT ALL. I wore this thing for 8 hours, plus during my exercise at the gym and for the WHOLE day it said that I only burned 300 calories. Which I know for a fact is not right. Also, the heart rate is not accurate. I was at a full sweat, heart beating real fast and it said my heart was at rest. Negative. I would use this only to tell time. That’s about it. Which, for $35 I can’t complain, but I won’t be using it again."

At least when the watch isn’t being used with Bluetooth. For work I do not have my phone on me so I wear watch without being paired up to phone. I’ve had this watch for 6 months and it’s time to purchase a different one."
679,stodd1020,"You get what you pay for. Cute for a $35 watch. I really just needed a step tracker for a fitness challenge and didn’t really want to spend $150. The time is the only thing accurate on this thing. You have to switch to walk mode in order to count steps and then there is no way to stop it without rebooting the device. The heart rate monitor doesn’t work. I have a wearable one at my gym and when it was reading 134 the watch was saying 85. I only wore it twice for sleep because I sleep pretty well. It said I never woke up even though I was up and had to go downstairs to tend to my dog. It does notify when you have a call and when you are ovulating, which I guess can be helpful to some.

684,Rachel Velasquez,"Awesome watch ! It took me a minute to figure it out ! It’s working great , Great watch for the price"
685,Jamie,"Doesn’t always give me my messages when they’re received. Sometimes I get them and sometimes just later. But other than that I like it. It tracks my steps, has a timer, and the battery lasts me a week before needing recharged."
686,Nadine Seaver,"This watch is MUCH cheaper than a fitbit or other smart watch, and I just use it for step tracking and workout calories counting. I like it, and have no problems with it!"

688,Tawnee,Love it!!!
689,Betty Phillips,"i specifically bought it to count steps, which it did not do. sent it back. it was very comfortable and i really liked it"
690,Jorge Q.,Bueno  Helpful
691,Elizabeth R. Bell,"This watch lasted about 40 days. I dove in the pool. About 30 minutes later, it shut off and never came back on."
692,Christi Bunting,I love this watch I was looking for something to help count my steps and check my heart rate and this surpassed my expectations I love that it lets me know about calls and texts and the relax part is very comforting for me. I definitely recommend this to everyone! 
693,ST,"This watch is excellent for the price, it tracks everything needed for fitness, plus receives messages etc. Performs all basic functions that expensive watches do, you wont notice any difference if you are a basic user....Plus as a bonus, the battery lasts for days...unlike the expensive ones which lasts only 24 -48 hours.. Excellent buy. "
694,Michelle Henrichsen,"I bought this item because it is water-proof, and I wanted a step-tracker that would also track yoga. It does all three!"
695,Jamie Donadio,I really am enjoying this product! My favorite part of the watch is the find my phone button! The battery life has been awesome I haven't had to charge it in 2.5 days!
696,Michaela,Bluetooth stopped connecting to phone about a week after started using. Thinking of returning it.
697,Amy B.,"5 stars! I love this watch! It was easy to set up, completely accurate, so comfortable to wear even to sleep and keeps a charge for at least a week maybe more and charges in 15 minutes! Highly recommend!!"
698,PJohnson,No instructions to learn to use . Boxing came in difficulty open . Could not figure it out on my own had to return .
699,jan,"I do like how easy it is to read the time. Time and silent alarm are the only 2 functions that work consistently. Steps, activity time, heart rate, and sleep time are inaccurate when they do give a reading. Sleep and heart rate are sporadic...sometimes days pass between data collection. I decided to keep this because of the big clock face, but to measure steps I still have to use a Fitbit on the other wrist."
700,Mari Bean,"The app wouldn't ""load"" the info from the watch, it never monitored my sleep, and didn't count all my steps."
701,Leonid Bafitos,love that it doesn't look too big. Everyone things it is an Apple watch. they look very similar only 10x cheaper and it works great!
702,Nancy Barnes,Like all the functions. This my second one. Can’t beat the price.
703,Lora Keene,I love all the features it has
704,Kindle Customer,"I got this watch for tracking my sleep mostly and my steps. It is accurate, light weight, and you can shower with It but I don't want to push my luck. The product is good and I got one that I can track via a weight loss app. Good investment. "
705,Chris Varela,"First time I've owened a smart watch, very easy to navigate and it's the perfect size, not to big not to small. Very happy with this devise. :)"
706,przib002,"I bought this after purchasing a different smartwatch that was more expensive and I couldn't be more happy. This watch is comfortable, a great value for the price, and it helps me be more aware of how much I'm sitting. "
707,SRT,I bought this product and it was defective I guess. told Amazon about it they quickly sent me another one and it's doing really well now
708,Tigger,"Tracking sleep, steps, and time! "
709,Jacalyn Shepherd,Much too complicated to understand directions to use
710,Karen Chapeton,Had trouble at first with connecting the messages to my watch so they could appear but then customer support instantly helped me. It said to wait 3 business day but they contacted me right after ! All the features work now and I’m so excited ! Would 100% recommend this watch to people !
711,Susan,Very sleek looking cute little watch. It has many functions and works very well. Especially for the price. Its perfect. I should buy all my friends one.
712,Ammon,"So far this watch has been great! My only complaint is how fast the pink bands got dirty. The first day of wearing it I realized it was looking dirty, I tried wiping it down and cleaning it and it wouldn't come off. I just wish I would have gone with black and could have avoided the weird color the bands are now."
713,FLO NIGHTINGALE,Watch stopped working at 33 days and the Return Window is 30 days!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY- do not waste your money!!!!
714,N. Shepard,
715,Amazon Customer,"The app paired with this watch tracker is horrible and constantly runs in the background at 100%, so I had to forcestop it. The watch keeps breaking my blue tooth connection, which makes the tracking features useless. Also, it needs blue tooth on, the phone close by and the app running for all of the tracking features to work. It worked for about 5 minutes, then kept breaking the connection. I gave it 2 stars only because of the band and watchface, which I like. I am keeping it for that reason to use as just a watch. Save your money and buy a better product."
716,Kalee,"I just got this today and I love it, it works so well and keeps up with my activities."
717,lagvegas,So far so good and for me waterproof! Mobile app could be a little better (refreshing stats) however for price its good. Battery life good.
718,Ruth C.,It's a nice smart watch for an amazing price! It works perfect! It is waterproof which is great!!! And the battery life is amazing! The app is super simple to use and follow! The watch is great quality and comfortable to wear all day.
719,Megan Tate,So far so good! Easy to set up. Only draw back is it controls the music that plays on my phone doesn’t play music from the watch from my phone. Which bummed me out.
720,Keith K,This was a good purchase. I do think that the battery doesn’t last as long as it should but for the price it was a good buy. I like it.
721,Daniel Ababio,I used this product to track my sleep measure my heart rate track my steps know my calories and my distance back and forth through out the day.
722,Gram Bon,"After finally getting this watch, my husband is happy with it. Will update after he has had a chance to use the different apps."
723,Kelly,"Easy to operate. App helps you customize your settings. It does more than just heart rate, Calorie burning and sleep rate. Text messages can be received, it has a phone locator and helps woman to keep up with her cycle. I am pleased with this Fitbit."
724,Go Grandma,I lost my 1st charger activate (I will have to pay for it so I can use it again) Got my watch but I can't get any farther that 10:57 . Please help.
725,Amazon Customer,"Love this watch! I bought it as a well needed upgrade to my previous smart watch that would slightly malfunction from time to time. Haven’t had any issues with this one & tracks activities, sleep and heart rate well! Very easy to use app! "
726,Mrs. Patti Hensley,The instructions that came with the watch are so small I can’t read it. I can’t even set the clock to the right time. Needs better instructions !!!
727,Rodolfo,Nice smart watch for the price
728,Jesus,I bought this so I could keep track of my heart rate and sleeping and it sucks at tracking both. I ended up returning it and still haven’t received a refund.
729,J,***DO NOT BUY ***DO NOT BUY ***CAUSED SEVERE PAIN!  Bought it for my mother on Mother's Day. Gave her great discomfort in her arm. Something strange about these devices. They've tried to scam me into taking down this review. They are a foreign based scam company that starts with the letter C. I'm not allowed to say who they are exactly because apparently Amazon algorithm won't let me.
730,Debbie R,"1st fitness tracker, easy to get it going and do basic things. Struggled learning how to have it monitor sleep."
731,koerner04,This watch has such a good price and it is easy to sync with the app. It even has an alarm for waking up or going to sleep. It has a great battery life so I only have to charge it every few days. I would definitely recommend this watch.
732,Maureen D.,The band was pink and when I wore jeans it picked up the blue and would not come clean. I emailed company 2 times and no reply sent back and got a different brand. 
733,Amazon customer,Good for watch but I dont think its all that accurate.. could be because I have skinny wrist area.. bulky for my wrist
734,Justine Reed,What the heck? I’ve only been using this watch for a month and the display is completely messed up. Just outside the return window of course 
735,D. Alexander,I’m sorry to say that this watch wasn’t as good as the other I. The same price range I had bought. I didn’t like the little dial button. It no longer keeps the time and I can’t seem to synchronize it with the app and my iPhone. It might be user error but my 22 year old tech savvy kid was at a loss too. Not my favorite.
736,Matt James,Details say “GPS - True” but you have to pair with your smartphone and use the smartphone’s GPS. Not practical and in other words “GPS - Untrue”. Disappointed. 
737,Bobby Hims,"This smartwatch is just as capable as my fitbit that recently broke. It is actually lighter and more comfortable than the fitbit versa. I am very happy with it and hope it lasts a long time. I wear it all day everyday, and it is holding up well.  One person found this helpful"

739,Cheif,"Delivery time ridiculously late. App is average, battery average."
740,Kindle Customer,"The watch is just OK. At this point....I use it more for time. I've done 30min on the treadmill several times, and while the treadmill says I've done about 1.5 miles and burned 350 calories.... the watch says I've walked .16 miles, 227 steps and burned 20 calories.... this has happened multiple times. I set my sleep intentions for 7 hours. I wake up at 530am..... but it doesn't say I wake up until after 830am!!! I stopped tracking my sleeping after the first week. Unfortunately, I'm outside of the return frame, otherwise I'd send it back. Long lasting battery is great. One person found this helpful"
741,BooBooChiChi,"Step tracker inaccurate - records arm movement in addition to leg movement. Sleep tracker is iffy. Heart rate accurate. Watchband is too wide and hot for long term use and irritates my wrist. If you need a cheap heart monitor until a real fitness device arrives, this works. If not, junk. No compensation for this review."
742,erika tandu,"One day I figurated that I left it in my short pocket which was in the laundry machine that had just finished to turn. I was terrified, but guest what the watch is ok. Totaly worthy for the price, and a special mention for the period alarm."
743,Denise Jett,It took me a bit to find the right app to download but once I did it’s been great. Charges in a hot second and the battery lasts a whole week.
744,Amazon Customer,It looks cool and does good things but I don’t like how the screen keeps coming on even while trying to sleep so I can’t sleep with it on

748,brandonr0613,I love this watch! It does so many different things and is such a great value. I love how I can track my workouts and sleep and receive all of my messages. 
749,andrea johnson,Everything connects well to iPhone. Reads easy. It’s for my teenage daughter. However the band color does show use like sweat or dirt easily. But other than that it has been good

752,Shawn,Works great. Almost the same as a Fitbit. I love it..
753,Valentina Craft,"I was looking for an easy way to track my morning exercise routine, and at the same time, something not that expensive. I found this watch very helpful. I can track my daily steps, my exercise, period, and see my messages. The app is also very easy to use. "
754,A N,I really like this but I wish there was a pc app. don't care that it doesn't monitor sa02.

759,April H,The watch is not accurate at tracking anything.
760,Fernanda Estrada,"Its my first fitness watch and it has been an incredible purchase, the style is amazing and the color is great. it never gets dirty, i don't have to charge the battery often so its durable. i highly recommend it to people looking for something not expensive."
761,B.H,I'm actually pretty impressed with this smart watch. It's definitely what you would call a bang for your buck!

771,Misha Torubara,The watch is easy to setup and navigate through. The battery life is good. It's been a week since I started wearing it and it's still running on the first charge. 
772,Karen McGuire,"Likes- battery life is great, one charge lasts for weeks! Display is easy to read, watch looks  Dislike- you have to use the app to see data, you can’t check steps on the watch"
773,MAC,Like the way tracks my steps
774,Lina T.,The image looks deceiving I ended up receiving a cheap chinese watch version and the returning method is a pain in the butt.
775,Jae,"I am struggling with how to set this watch up. I purchased and was excited for the sleep and steps tracking. The instructions that come with the watch just tell you what's on it, not how to set up and use. Took day one to figure out how to turn it on and connect to phone. Day two it did not record anything and I still can not find how to set up the sleep tracking. Very frustrating and there are no directions online to help with this set up either. I even tried YouTube nothing..... I am sure it is the operator but I am not tech stupid and this is a matter of poor instructions that tells you very little. 2 people found this helpful"

789,Denise,This is absolutely the best smart watch on the market! Haven’t showered with it on yet but it is suppose to be waterproof. The battery last longer than the Apple Watch. I’ve had it on since Christmas Eve & it’s still 3/4 of the way charged! Would definitely buy again & will refer my friends
790,Yvonne,I love it. Battery last days...
791,Parmela Gaston,So far it’s working good
792,Megan,"Honestly did not expect much from such a cheap watch but seriously cannot even get the display to light up without rebooting the device. I turned my wrist every which way and still could not get the screen to light up, however, when it's lying flat on a table it tends to turn on whenever it feels. I even turned the wrist sense completely off and attempted to use the function button to display, still wouldn't work. I honestly cannot attest to any of its other functions as I can't even get it to turn on consistently (aka when I'd like to check the time) Honestly, don't buy it. It's only $40, yes, but you could spend that $40 on something that actually worked, this can't even work as a watch. 2 people found this helpful"
793,T,Watch works perfectly as a fitness tracker and has different training modules. Excellent battery life. Nearly a week. Great price. Does everything that fitbit does for a fraction of the price. IP68 rated for wet conditions. I love this thing. Been using it every day for nearly 2 months now.

799,kriston william,For the price it’s a good little watch everyone thinks it’s an Apple Watch when they look at my wrist
800,Jb,"Wouldn't charge, therefore couldn't get it to work. Now past the 30 days so I am out $40"
801,kenneth a,This fitpolo tracker was and is such a disappointment. It doesn’t keep accurate pulse rate and it is so bad for the sleep tracker that it is useless. I am being honest about this watch and not exaggerating at all. I tried to get help from product support and it said they will reply within 2 days. Never heard back from them! I waisted 39 dollars because it was opened and can’t return for refund. I really had hoped it was going to be a good fitness tracker for me as I am recovering from a long rare lung disease and have just started walking. I bought my wife a Fitbit versa2 and she loves it.

854,Fatema Ali," This watch shows steps even if you are sitting and not moving!!! It showed 1500 steps in 15 minutes, while i was actually sitting still in my place all that time, and I wasn't even moving my arms or anything, i was literally staying still in my place, and it was right after I received the package and opened it and did the setting, so it was not even like a delayed recording of the steps or anything like that!!  Sooo disappointing, and sooo not worth the money!! I bought cheaper chinese fitness trackers before, and they were really more reliable and accurate than this one!! 2 people found this helpful"

856,Karen,Ok for the price
857,Angel👼😇,"My partner loves his fitness tracker. It's easy to use, it's accurate, and moble app is easy to navigate. His favorite feature is being able to get phone notifications on his watch. A much cheaper version than getting an apple watch. "

861,Tryscorer PRG,"I wanted a tracker that had more functions on it. So I thought Id try this one out. The app, the watch features are very nice. started to use this watch and although my step activity went down significantly. So I used my phone, old step tracker and this watch during two runs. Both the old watch and phone tracked nearly identical (7500), but the Fit polo showed I only did about 4200. The second trial old watch and phone, 16,000 steps, the fitpro 8000. Something isnt right. so I returned it ."

If an “activity monitor” can’t even properly track steps, what’s the point? Their customer service was great but after awhile of corresponding, they still couldn’t offer a proper fix. At that point, I stated I would be returning the device. THEN THEY SAID THEY WOULD GIVE ME A FULL REFUND AND LET ME KEEP THE WATCH IF I GAVE THEM A 5 STAR REVIEW. Absolutely not. I’m not going to tell everyone this is an excellent product and have them waste their money on something worthless. Useless product from company with no morals. 57 people found this helpful"

1070,Amazon Customer,"I had a lot of good experiences and a few frustrating experiences too. It is a very slim design and works very well for a while. The app works great and the steps tracker works good. I really like the graph so you can see how much sleep, steps etc. you got on a specific day. The battery is incredible! If you have the lift wrist setting off, you can go 2 or 3 MONTHS without charging it! (yes months, not days). A few downsides however... (keep in mind i've been using this watch for about 2 years) the black paint around the face fades off fairly quickly. I had to replace the bands after about a year because they were breaking. It is NOT waterproof at all. I put my arm in water for 3 seconds and now it goes haywire, changing the settings, buzzing at random times (didn't appreciate that at 2:00 in the morning 😂). I tried setting it in rice and it didn't help. And one downside about the app, if you don't open the app every few days, it loses the data for a few of the days and there is not a way to recover it. It reports 0's all around if you don't open the app every like 4ish days. Overall, it is a very good watch. But just as anything, it deteriorates."

1072,Amazon Customer,Doesn't work properly. I reset it a million times and it won't track heart rate.
1073,Amazon Customer,Poor quality
1074,K&L,"I got this smart watch mainly to alert me when I had messages or phone calls and didn’t have my phone right next to me. It had the added features of step counter and sport tracker but they were not very accurate. The heart rate monitor was also a cool function but can’t speak about accuracy for that either.  It helped me stay off my phone constant checking off I had messages so it was a great watch for the price. The battery life was awesome, didn’t need to charge it but once a week. But then after just under 2 years of use, the touch screen doesn’t register very well, and the battery doesn’t stay charged more than a day and a half. The band broke maybe 6 months before but that was easily replaceable. I can’t say whether I’d recommend this watch because I’m looking at different options for a replacement. Is it worth $30 for 2 years of use?"
1075,Michael Sutton,The watch was great until I missed placed the charger and after many attempts to contact the company I now have a watch that does not work do not purchase anything from this company they will not respond to you

1092,MecaLee79,so i purchased this watch about a year ago. I loved it it did everything i needed it to do. now it will no longer connect to the app the Bluetooth on the watch itself isn't turning on so the watch will not connect to the app. so now I am no longer able to count my steps or keep track of my sleep. WTF in light of this i would not recommend this watch unless your looking to buy one annually. so disappointed in this item. and the app as well. I also noticed that if I do yoga it doesn't always keep track or count my yoga as a workout as movement. which also defeats the purpose of having the watch as well. when this watch communicated with other all like my health anything that's not waking or running will not be tracked as apart of your fitness.. which to me is ridiculous. all activates should count.

I am not sure how accurate it was at tracking steps we never tested it, but it got her motivated to get in steps, which was the goal. We are back to buy a replacement and get a few more for our other kids. Longevity and step accuracy may not be the best, but for our purposes, it’s fine."

1144,Giselle,"My husband gave me the watch Dec 2020. After one week, the pink band discolored. Today (2 years later) the display has lines on it. The swiping doesn't work and the display will change to different functions like heartbeat, walk tracking, etc. The sleep monitoring doesn't work well, ifit doesn't track sleep after 942am and it doesn't track of I take a nap. This watch is only good for time. "
1145,BonTom,"I normally wear a Timex Ironman but was looking for a heart rate monitor for swimming after a 2-year Covid layoff. This watch performs that function very well so far: water resistant enough for normal pool workout and pulse readings accurate enough for variation from resting pulse up to 140+ bpm. Battery is very good, averaging 10-12 days per charge. Helps to keep brightness setting low. Pedometer appears to work well when compared with others I own. The band fits my small wrist very well. Software works well on my Google phone. For the price, I don't think you can beat this watch."
1146,Amazon Customer,"My Fitbit was recalled, so I purchased this as an affordable replacement. The watch itself is very stylish and had a long battery life. Unfortunately, I found the calorie burn and step counter to be HIGHLY inaccurate, though the heart rate monitoring was okay. I only use my smartwatch to track my exercise, so it wasn't useful for me. The app is also not the greatest, leading me to return this purchase. I guess you do get what you pay for. Patiently waiting for my recall refund to come through so I can buy a new Fitbit.

1148,Andrew M.,"I like the feature that allows me to see texts from my phone. That way I can just leave my phone charging in the other room and not miss texts (or know they are not worth getting up to reply to). Tracks steps OK, the vibration alarm is nice, and overall the watch works well. Heart rate is not accurate and is way too low or too high.  My biggest issue is that they don't last. I have gone through 2 of them in less than 2 years. The first one the band broke off. Support did reply and send me a new one for free. The second one the screen got all full of lines and the touch screen stopped working. No response from support, my guess is they knew I already got a replacement and didn't want to send a 3rd watch, but a response would have been nice. I know it is a cheap watch, but I expected a bit more.   "

1153,Michael Heintz,"I like the watch, it stays linked up via bluetooth to my android phone, counts my steps pretty accurately, but is sometimes hard to get a reading on my heart rate, instead all it has is -- a lot of the time. All in all I got what I paid for, I'd say. The issue for me is the camera hidden under the screen at the top of the display. WHY?? IT'S COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY! God only knows what personal information is being recorded. I circled the area in the attached photo - tilt the screen at just the right angle and you'll see it. I'll be covering it up with a little piece of electrical tape, thank you very much! "
1154,Meghan,"I’ve had this watch for over 8 months now, and it’s nothing fancy but it gets the job done. Need your steps and sleep tracked? This is perfect. Heart rate is a little iffy, so if you’re looking for a heart rate/oxygen tracker this isn’t it. Different workout options are pretty cool, not sure how accurate the calorie tracker is. Screen is absolutely unbreakable, and the watch is waterproof. BATTERY IS INCREDIBLE!!!! I charge mine every 2.5/3 WEEKS! Relax feature is a little silly, but I still use it. Alarms are good features but don’t rely on them to wake you up, it’s a bad habit to just press the side button and turn it off. Music connection works well, especially when using headphones. Has a Find My Phone feature, so if you misplace your phone as long as it’s bluetooth connected it’ll buzz it. App is okay, could be better as you have to click on and swipe up and wait for app to sync information about sleep and heart rate and such, but once you get the hang of it it’s pretty cool. Perfect for what I needed, and for $35 it’s unbeatable. Highly recommend. 3 people found this helpful"

It’s been knocked around loading a kiln, dunked in buckets of water, covered in clay/slip, run under water numerous times a day, and I’ve never had any issues. It still holds a charge for about a week. For the price, you can’t beat this watch."

Even my 80 year old Mom uses hers every day, and its encouraged her to be more active. 🧡 "
1158,Amazon Customer,I bought this after my fit bit wore out. This is an awesome watch. Like it better than the more expensive fit bit. Have had it for a little over a year and it works great. Easy to read dial. Silent alarm works great. Easy to recharge. Battery lasts a long time. I recharge it once every 3 weeks. Highly recommend this watch.
1159,Ashley Nicole,"This has been an awesome watch for my daughter who just turned 9. I read a lot of reviews and looked at a lot of watches before purchasing this one. The step counting seems accurate, and she likes comparing steps with family members and reaching her goal for the day. She also likes the weekly totals, so she can track, not only daily but weekly steps and stats. Other favorite features are the alarm, tracking sleep, and changing the watch face. She also uses the timer and stopwatch a lot for daily activities and when playing or racing with friends. There are a lot of choices for sport modes. She uses walking, biking and running the most. It makes activity fun, when she can start her watch before our bike rides or walking. One of the best things about this watch is the battery life. It lasts a LONG time. For sure a week, it lasts her two weeks with minimal use. The magnetic charger makes it easy for her to charge the watch on her own. The pink color is very pretty, but the band did fade and look discolored after maybe 3-4 months of wear. We have now had this watch for almost a year. My daughter has worn it every day, and we have experienced no problems besides the discoloring of the band, and scratches on the face of the watch. I emailed customer support about these issues and received a response the same day! Because of the 1 year warranty, we received a replacement watch for free! This watch is a great value for the features and price, and we experienced excellent customer support!! I would definitely purchase this watch again!!"
1160,Ryam,"I originally thought mine was defective because it disconnected every time I closed the app even after following the instructions and all of the troubleshooting. Turns out the instructions only work for IOS, even though they say they are for Android, too. In order to get it to work for Android, you have to lock the app so it stays running in the background. That little bit of info would have saved me a lot of frustration and time researching the issue. They need to update the instructions for those of us not on IOS."

1162,Shianne," At first I thought I was going crazy because this watch was reading very sporadic heart rates sometimes very low sometimes very high, I use my pulse ox on my finger to see if the heart rate was similar to the watch and it was not so then I began to test it on objects that do not have heartbeats and I have noticed that it still acts like it is taking a measurement and we’ll go high, low, and bounce like it would on a human except this has been tested on the floor on the counter and on a paper towel roll all of them had readings but none of them clearly have Heartbeats this is a waste of money if you are wanting something that you can monitor your heart rate with do not buy this watch steps are also off daily about 1k "
1163,Kindle Customer,"I think this is my second review, as an update I still love the watch. It holds great charge. I can’t use my phone at work, but with this I am able to see missed calls and texts without taking my phone out since I have it nearby hidden. This is the main reason I purchased it to see calls from my kids. I also have to date and time everything at work so I don’t have to constantly turn to see the clock it’s on my wrist. I hate that the strap is dirty and looks nasty and can’t be cleaned. It has looked this way two weeks after purchasing. I’m going to order a replacement strap darker color. "
1164,Squawk,"Don't waste your money. Just wanted inexpensive watch that offered heart rate monitor. Watch can't even keep time. Must sync with phone app every few days to main accurate time within a minute. Heart monitor is useless. Completely inaccurate. Highly fluctuates between 80 to 165 bpm while on spin bike when range should be 125 to 155 bpm. Heart rate sensor defective. Had to drain battery completely to disengage solid green light. Now software is defective. Watch jumps to different functions without touch. Other times, touch or scroll screen but nothing happens. Have previous generation watch Fitpro looks identical to current model. Now called Fitpolo. Merchant changed name. THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I'VE EVER PURCHASED FROM AMAZON! Stay away!"
1165,Mr. Blue,"Had one of these from a different seller. The watch is good for a starter smartwatch, cheap everyday/work alternative for a more active folks, and for kids or teens that want a smartwatch as well.  The battery life is very good and will last for days. The watch itself is quite durable and can definitely take a beating.  But it really is just that of a starter watch to dip your toes into the smartwatch world. As a result, it's nothing special and lacks a lot of options you'd get from something like a fossil gen 5 or a galaxy watch. You're not going to be able to take calls (only reject) or reply to messages with it. You also don't get any meaningful customization options."

1171,ThomasBlue 🐕,"Thanks to Huazhixing customer support the issue I had with the first watch was resolved with a replacement. This review has been updated to reflect my positive experience with Huazhixing and the product's performance.  The watch is used by my wife and she mostly wants to track her daily steps. I tested it by walking around for awhile and compared my actual step count to the displayed count; It was a match. My wife also did this step test and the watch accurately counted her steps as well.  The touch screen is convenient and works well. For example, the color display presents fitness statistics by swiping up. And battery life is good; it's worn only during waking hours and at the end of the week it still has at least 40% remaining charge.  I setup the display to automatically turn-on by a wrist raising/twisting motion. There is a delay before the screen appears, so wait a moment to allow it to wake up. It automatically turns off after a few seconds, (or sooner if the wrist lowered).  The VeryFitPro App is mandatory for initially setting up the watch. It is also used to sync the watch data in order to maintain a record of the fitness data. My wife reviews her fitness information on the watch's screen and only uses the app at the end of the week to sync & save the data.  Occasionally the watch will have trouble connecting to the VeryFitPro Android App. I found that temporarily turning off the phone's WiFi setting helps solve this issue when it occurs.  Review Summary: The watch is comfortable, look good, and does the job. The low price makes it a very good deal.              "
1172,Jaime Murillo R,It is a nice smart watch for excersice but not very precise. The price is good. The GPS only works well when you connect it to your phone. The watch don't have as many funtions as I was hopping. The watch is touch only in one point. Don't have differente bright options. If you want something better you should spend about $40 - $50.

1175,snow0160,"I’ve used pretty much all the smart watches available on the market and this one is incredible value. I bought the first smart watch on the market more than a decade ago when Pebble released it. It was incredible! Then Pebble sold their smart watch to Fitbit. I have also owned the versa2, and it is pretty much this watch with the heavy price tag. Don’t forget there is no additional annual subscription fee with this $30 watch. I also own the Apple Watch Series 5. So you’d ask why am I buying another watch? Because of the short battery life of the Apple Watch, I have to charge it every night. I use my smart watches to wake me up in the morning and to track my sleep. This feature is invaluable to me. This watch does an amazing job with its alarm vibration.  Those negative reviews on the accuracy of this watch is highly exaggerated. Each watch will have a margin of error even the Apple Watch. For example, I also own a Polar H10 heart rate monitor. My Apple Watch is about 25% off in the hourly caloric count from the Polar chest band. No watch is perfect, this come pretty close!"
1176,Jeff,"The watch itself is fine and works as it says. However the watch broke within the one year warranty and when I reached out to them they ignore my email.  1. Watch works good for as long as it continues to work. 2. It's not built the best, so when it breaks just know they will ignore you and not honor their word."
1177,duceylady,"I bought the watch with a pink band. I wore a new black cotton blouse; while wearing the watch, by the time I got home, the band had picked up the black color from the blouse. I have tried everything, including acetone and the dye will not come out. I would be too embarrassed to wear the watch unless I was doing gardening. It must be a combo of cheap band composite and cheap dye in my blouse. So disappointed I didn't purchase in black.  One person found this helpful"

The pink band turns black within a few days and you can't clean it off so ugly, so I bought a new black band and it worked fine. After that really happy with all the functions and it is a beautiful display. Wish there was a sleep mode though so it doesn't turn on all night but you can't have everything. Then one day the swipe on it just stopped working so I couldn't change it to see my steps or anything. So I was super bummed because I love it when it works! I guess it's just hit or miss with these cheaper made trackers. I ordered another one from a different seller and with a few upgrades on it so we'll see how long this one last. If it craps out I will not buy anymore watches here on Amazon."
1183,Kindle Customer,It’s as good as FIT Bit - at a fraction of the cost. Just haven’t figured out all the bells and whistles
1184,Eliabel Rosario,Buen producto Helpful
1185,Mary Gobel Clardy,great value
1186,stacey,"This watch never works, I am mid movement always and it’s telling me to move. Verified my heart rate with another monitor at the hospital.. way off. Who knows if it even track steps correctly, wish I realized this was so off sooner to get my money back. At least I can save someone else , This cheap junk is just that junk.. save your money."
1187,jo ives,"You get what you pay for. After a month the only thing that works on my Fitpolo watch is the time. The display is great but I really don't like having to push a button to see it. All the other features aren't available because I cannot get the ""touch"" features to work. I knew going into this that $33 was not going to give me a durable high quality fitness watch, but 30 days?????"
1188,Tricia Lopez,Love this fitness tracker. Accurate step counter and heart rate monitor. I have not missed a phone call or a notification.
1189,Tomdok,"I did not buy mine thru Amazon, but from an ad I saw. I got it and half the full actions either didn't work or were not accurate. When I contacted them they offered me a $16 refund d and I could keep the watch or I could return it to China for a full refund. Would not suggest buying it."
1190,john n clark,Great watch for the price I have a Samsung watch that i have to charge every night This has a simple menu and that's all i need. Looks like a apple watch for one third the price. I had it for 2 weeks and no problem. Amazed me with all the features for less than 40 bucks
1191,Valerie Webb,"Awesome watch, great dupe for the Apple Watch. Supper fashionable"
1192,JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS,"I was very pleased with this product for the price. It easily syncs with smartphone via app. After sync is complete, which takes about 2 minutes, you can easily keep track of vitals and track fitness goals as well as have access to various things like the relaxation exercise. It fits nicely and is very light weight. I have very small wrists and the band has plenty of adjustment slots to make it fit comfortably. This watch makes a great gift for others or to yourself as an investment in personal health."
1193,J P. Rich,"Great price, looks like the overpriced Apple Watch, and does the job for me. Tracks steps and sleep, has different brightness levels for sleep and battery conversion, and on full brightness its stop watch function gives me a backup when I referee soccer games! Doesn’t need to be recharged for several days if not kept on full brightness. One person found this helpful"
1194,edward j costantino,My daughter loved her watch 
1195,Norman L,The watch promptly arrived in one day. The watch came fully charged. Then I realized the time it was giving me is 15 minutes too fast. Once I managed to download the app the watch wouldn't pair with the phone. I promptly returned the watch.
1196,Fanny A.,Watch is nice but pink band gets dirty and it can’t be cleaned. Looks awful. Don’t get the pink
1197,Adita,It was great 
1198,afdesserts,"Love the large display, accuracy and ease of use. Much better than Fitbit Charge 4! Happy I bought it. "
1199,Maria,"I bought this watch one week ago and it works perfectly. The size is perfect, it has many functions and all work very well. Step tracking and sleep monitoring is very accurate. I really recommend this smart watch. It is very cheap and very complete.  38 people found this helpful"
1200,Luciana Butera,"Play Video  I love this watch! It looks very classy and good quality, Ive received many compliments and people have said it looks just like an Apple watch. Great battery life, it's still at 50 percent since the day I purchased it around 10 days ago. It tracks your activity like the exercise you do I like how I will get notification apps in the watch even if my phone is far away. Overall satisfied :) "
1201,Shannon Gemmell,Overall this watch is good for price. Battery life is longer than I expected. The app is easy to use. The band however started to turn a blue color after a week or so. It's also really big for my very small wrist. Ended up cutting it down to fit better.  One person found this helpful
1202,Allisson,"This is a really good watch and the app is easy to work. I love how it accurately measures my sleep, heart rate. The battery life is super long which is nice. I’ve never owned a smart watch before and wanted something simple and that was a good Apple Watch dupe, and this is perfect! Setting it up took only 10 minutes. For a watch that’s so cheap it’s amazing quality "
1203,Randall,"Around 1.5 hours spent setting up this watch which would not frustrate me but the fact that the following morning the main button on the side of the watch was missing was almost comical! I tried to save some money and just had to learn the hard way. When you receive inside your warranty Package a note saying collect your $15 by submitting a positive review I should have known. O well the good news is I won't make the same mistake again. Buyer beware, you do get what you pay for! One person found this helpful"
1204,Mark,"Let me start by being clear, this is not an apple watch or samsung active watch substitute. It has maybe 1/4 of the features BUT at 1/10 of the price. I was worried about the quality and accuracy but I tested the heart rate monitor with 3 other devices and it works great. For the price you can't ask for a better watch \ hear rate monitor. It is comfortable to wear and not to big. This is perfect for my kids\teens who want a solid watch with a few added functions like heart rate monitor and message notifications. I have been testing it for several days straight without charging and it still has over 50% battery, which I REALLY like.  The only complaint I have is the app. We have purchased several other similar watches and many of them use the VeryFitPro app, which I am not a big fan of. If they had a better app this could go head to head with fitbit. One person found this helpful"
1205,S_kh,"Got 2 of these as Christmas gifts for my oldest boys. The black and green look exactly as pictured and very nice. I have an Apple Watch and at first glance you can’t tell the difference. Haven’t charged or used yet since they’re gifts, but will update if there are any issues."
1206,Thomas W McIntyre,"Works good, does everything it’s suppose to do."
1207,Breanna Lockman,"I'm impressed by this watch especially for the price I've had it 10 days so far and use the sports app everyday and it's at 40% which is amazing, the only down part is the band doesn't want to stay out with the little band holder but that's ok and the heart rate monitor isn't accurate it will say 89 when my heart rate is actually 120 but for the price I'm happy.  11 people found this helpful"
1208,J Nice,"Updated... I received a replacement for the defective device I originally received.  I like the options, heart beat monitor, notifications & exercise tracker. The replacement watch works much better then the original one, I think it was defective. It seems pretty accurate for the step counter and the sports tracker. I use this in conjunction with my phone which also tracks these exercises     2 people found this helpful"
1209,mike isaacs,"We ordered this watch for my son, who desperately wanted an I Watch and were hoping for the best. We got it last night, put it on him and immediately the band came out of the socket. We thought it was just a fluke thing so we put it on him today to wear and it did it again. Luckily with him noticing, so it didn't get lost, but we will be returning!! Poor Quality!"
1210,Mariana,"I have had others fitbands and this one is really good, it is worth, and it looks like an Apple Watch lol, it has everything that a fitband could have, long battery I have 5 days and it still charged. If you are looking for a stylish fit band this one is for you. The app is easy to use, and you can control your music, you can see your notifications of apps from you phone. Also you can get into the pool or shower and it works pretty good. One of my favorite thing is the gps to track my running, I was looking a fit band for that."
1211,Amazon Customer,The watch stopped working on the first time I went to swim with it. Very disappointed. I needed to track my water workout. 
1212,Sierra Lover,"This item was comfy to wear and the app was good. But the heart rate monitor was providing me with very low readings, sometimes it'd be off by 50%. I checked my HR using old-fashioned count-the-beats as well as using my cell phone HR monitor. I contacted their tech support and their reply was prompt. I was prompted for more info which I provided, then never heard back. Oh well... Needless to say I returned it and purchased another brand, much to my liking."
1213,Ganesh Balakrishnan,"My kids love the watch, very easy to use. Data is accurate and great battery too. Excellent customer service."
1214,Jeffer,"El reloj está bonito. Llegó bien. Se enlazo con mi iPod 7 pero no me llega la notificación de WhatsApp. Llegan la Messenger, Instagram. Helpful"
1215,Tammy Bertelsen,"I got this watch for Christmas and it is now July. I went on vacation for 10 days and didn't want to bring my charger. So, I charged my watch the morning that we left and it still has 18% left on it 2 weeks later! I was shocked. I have the pink one and the band gets dirty almost instantly. I have tried everything to get it clean and nothing works. I have already replaced it once and need to replace it again. I am thinking of switching to a black band so it will last longer."
1216,Paula akujor,"I can honesty say i love this watch! It tracks all my steps & have a Relax option that helps with my breathing ! Watch is sturdy , battery mode is Great , very good investment and will be a cool gift to give . You don’t have to spend over 200$ for an Apple Watch , save your money !   "
1217,Carolyn Vanya,Doesn’t track steps very well
1218,Yash,"This watch has all the features it's description says. The most important one I liked personally is, ability to track my heart-rate 24 hours so I can know when my heart-rate was high and try to figure out why it was at that specific time. Another best feature would be water-proof, I am a regular swimmer so I wear it every day while swimming and it works seamlessly. Alarms in this app are a huge plus, as I live with roommates, I don't want to wake them up with loud noise, since I got this watch, watch vibrations are good enough to awake me and I don't have to disturb my roommate's sleep. The reason why the watch is totally worth it, I am able to track my daily steps, my sleep, and heart-rate data through the app. I wish, they could support more than 10 alarms as I like to have it as different reminders, but overall this watch is totally worth it, I am happy with the product, would highly recommend to others as well  One person found this helpful"
1219,Lynnea Mae Cramer,"As a Healthcare worker this watch works perfectly. Water proof and isn't in the way and tracks my sleeping pattern in great detail; deep sleep, light sleep and how long it took me to get up. I have had it a week and have not had to charge it yet, battery life is amazing and so many other awesome features. 10 stars.    "
1220,Maranda Hall,The step calculator is off. It tracks 25-40steos per step lol the end of the day my 10 year old has 9 million steps.

1221,Maggie,"I was sent the right color & the functionality is great! I would really recommend this watch especially if you cannot afford an Apple Watch. I broke mine and rather than forking over $200 to replace the broken screen, I decided to go ahead and buy a completely new affordable watch. This watch from the FitStore has also a sleek design. It comes with a charger and a guide.  It’s doing a great job at making me get up and put in my daily steps. I’m very happy with my purchase thus far.   "
1222,Marissa Estrada,"This was my 1st fitness watch. I ordered and received my watch the same day, it came fully charged and ready to go so I was able to download the app and set it up before I went to bed. Not only is it super cute but I like all the little extras it has, it tracked my sleep fairly well! I kept record to test the accuracy and it did the job. I've used the step counter, timer and calorie burner, I've also set it up to allow me to get notifications on my phone. I see incoming calls, text msgs, as well as emails and social media notifications. I turn the notifications off when I want to workout so I don't get distracted. I also like that I can control my music from it! Overall it's a great fitness watch for me!😌 "
1223,Maria fernanda,"I like it, it’s really comfortable cause it doesn’t feel heavyweight, it’s convenient and easy to use. I’m wearing it all the time so I’m constantly looking the sleep tracking and it’s great!. The battery life is during for 3-4 days and that’s fantastic. I recommend it! "
1224,Tammy,Very happy with this purchase!
1225,Amazon Customer,"Amazing (especially for the price). Great quality, Amazing customer service (they registered the watch for me and checked to make sure I was happy with the purchase). It actually fits my wrist - I have a small wrist so every watch I purchase I have to buy a smaller band but not this one, I still had holes to make it smaller (and of course there were several to make it larger). It has so many great features! Super easy to get started, linked to the app and my phone with no problem and I am not very tech savy ;) Love this watch!! "
1226,Alyssa Kachelhoffer,"Worked great for the first week! Doesn't accurately track sleep or steps and my message notifications stopped working after 2 weeks. Haven't exposed to water so I can't verify how ""waterproof"" it is but the band discolors after a while. One person found this helpful"
1227,Mehak,"I absolutely love this watch. Haven’t taken it off since I received it. It has inspired me to take more steps, burn more calories and walk more miles. It measures everything accurately. I’ve been doing some dance workouts at home and I can now see how many calories each of them burns. A fully charged battery lasts up to one week. It also looks great on the wrist as an accessory. My boyfriend saw mine and bought one the next day. "
1228,Jessica,Absolutely amazing product. This watch stays charged much longer than any of my other sports watches I have ever used. Touchscreen works wonderfully. Steps of pedometer is very accurate and wristband could easily fit a large varity of wrist sizes. Overall I cannot complain about anything at all this is truely the same quality as the high priced sports watches at a much more reasonable price.
1229,Lisa Jones,"These are AWESOME! Purchased 1 for myself and the hubby. They are easy to install. I like the options for heart rate and different exercises. I do not wear it to bed so I'm not sure how the sleep tracking is, but if it tracks like the other options then no worries there! My only critique of it is I wish it had different band options., but other then that it's a great tracker for the price! My husband LOVES his."
1230,Halil,"I like this watch a lot because of the notifications you get when you don’t have your phone with you sit if the time. The tracking of how many steps you take is really nice I reach 10,000 steps almost everyday. So,this is perfect for my daily walks and wellness. The watch features are easy to find and the info is helpful. I especially like the information it provides; steps taken, heart rate, time, calories burned, and much more.

1231,Jerome T.,"This is actually my second purchase and I bought this for my wife. She has been borrowing mine and has been pretty impressed with it. This watch has all the essential tools for fitness, so I can check the progress of my activities during the day, such as steps, HR, calories count & even sleep pattern. I love being able to smoothly connect with my phone and control music player, get notifications for messages/ calls, reminders and alarm notifications. The touch screen is also very responsive. Battery life is amazing. We are loving and very pleased with this watch.  "
1232,Sarah,Works great as just a step counter and stopwatch/clock. The text read feature is practically useless and the music feature does not work with my phone.  I got it mostly for the step feature which is very useful but you have to sync your steps to the phone before midnight or the app won't keep the days record.
1233,LCris,"I really like this watch, it has a perfect design and such good quality, my favorite features are the activities tracker and music control, also receiving notifications from messages ( Instagram, WhatsApp, iMessage) and calls. The battery life is really up to 10 days, I’ve been using it for 7 days and it still has 70%. The app is very easy to set up and manage. So far no cons!"
1234,Stephanie Loftis,"This is a great alternative to more expensive options!!! The band is comfortable and gives a lot of size options. It is easy to wear all day and night.

1237,Milie2619,"It is amazing watch, it really works with iPhone. You can se your notifications of facebook, text messages, whatsapp and email at the watch. Last night I track my sleep, it is work perfect and show you on the app everything. I charge one night and that battery was for almost 3 days.

I have the Fitbit watch and it's so similar at first glance it's hard to tell the difference. It last about 9 days on a full charge, The steps are always correct.

1252,Donna Bennett,"I basically use the fitness tracker as a watch and to count steps and calories burned. My daughter had bought me one prior to this watch which I had for over a year before it had fallen off my wrist while shopping. I never did find the watch, but I missed it because it worked so well and had really great battery life ( 3 weeks or more before needing a charge ). I immediately looked for another identical watch on Amazon and found one supplied by Fitpolo and made the purchase. I was very pleased with the watch for 3- 1/2 months until if fell off my arm while I was walking to my car. The watch strap had come off one side of watch body and noticed that the mounting area with the hole for the strap pin was broken. I went to Email: Support@fitpolo.us and explained the issue I had to a nice lady named Sharon whom was very helpful. She asked me to send photo's of the damaged watch in which I did along with a copy of my Amazon receipt. She replaced my broken watch within a few days and I am very happy ! Thank you for the great service Fitpollo and to Sharon. I would recommend this company because they stand behind the products they sell ! 2 people found this helpful"

1304,Shelby major, Great watch for the price. Does everything i need it to do.
1305,Kelly A.,Good watch for the price. Got it as a gift for my cousin and she loves it. Easy to set up and looks like keep an accurate track. The bands are really comfortable too

1307,Isabella,"I gave to my boyfriend as a gift and he love it, it’s is the perfect size, with all the options to track your steps, calories and sleep. Really nice looking and also a light clock, not heavy, came with a cable to charge it and in a great material, arrived really fast !!! "

1313,joshua mcdougal,Great watch for running! I’ve had this wash for a couple weeks now and it still runs as perfect as the day I got it! Really simple to use!
1314,Juliana Navarro,"Es un producto de muy buena calidad y a un muy buen precio, yo principalmente lo he usado para la piscina y no he tenido ningún inconveniente con el agua, aunque también cumple sus demás funciones, se conecta fácilmente a la aplicación en el celular y la batería puede durar 7 días.

1315,Kathy C,"Loved this watch so much I ordered another tells you when you have a call. Or text, durability waterproof is awesome wear mine every day I clean pools every day I'm really hard on my watches and this one has no problems battery lasts around 2 weeks easy to charge I have a tendency to scratch the face on it that's why I'm getting another one going to get shieds for face this time if you need a long lasting watch this is it it also has allot of other features"
1316,Elsa,"I really like this watch ..it has long battery life and seems to be pretty accurate..my only issue is it doesn't register when pushing carts and such may not be a big deal for some but I push them for a living..once I figured that out and started pulling them different my steps went from low 2-3 thousand to over 10,000 so it was missing tons of steps just because my arms aren't at my sides when I walk ..other than that this is a great watch ..if not for that I'd give it five stars"
1317,Tommy,charges fasts and lasts days. not bad for the price
1318,Jacob,Great watch
1319,wanda winslow,"overall i am happy with the watch. I am not able to have my phone with me at work, so i rely on the phone to advise me of my calls and texts. This watch does not. i am happy with the other tracking, but i really needed to receive my text and i do not."
1320,Debra Hodge,so far its great. I use it for walking and workouts.
1321,Mila Clark,I’m loving it so far. I use it every day during cardio and weights and it seems to be pretty accurate. I’m think I’m getting one for hubby 
1322,Robert,"Its a nice product , very easy to use , and quite cheap prices with high Quality fitness tracker watch"
1323,Deborah C.,Love the item
1324,Great Deals IL,"The smart watch has value for the price. However, I purchased one just over a year ago, in 2021, but several functions began to fail. The motion command that displays time stopped working. Then the ""walk"", ""treadmill"" and ""run"" activity commands stopped functioning as they did when the smart watch was a few months old. With this written, I purchased my second smart watch in August 2022, because for the price, it is a very good buy."
1325,Anays,"Excelente producto, pero si me gustaría que añadieran otros colores para la pantalla inicial. Helpful"
1326,isaac sakkal,Excelent smart watch!
1327,Chrissy Burns,The battery life on this watch is exceptional! I love the display and especially the sleeping tracking! I love how the app has so many great features and data collection! It really helps with staying in the fit path. You can’t beat this watch/fitness tracker for the price! 
1328,Viridiana MC,"I really needed one of this to track my progress while running. I think it's excellent; comfortable to wear, pretty accurate measurements, love the pink color and battery life lasts more than I would imagine, I've used it for one whole week and it still has 90% battery life. "
1329,Shirley Collins,Does not count steps consistently.
1330,Tiffany,"Love the accuracy of the step counter, it keeps me motivated to keep walking!"
1331,Colorado Springs,"We found the watches to function as advertised. My Smart watch is linked to my Samsung G9 and spousal unit is synced to her iPhone. I like the monitor to my heart rate and non-certified BP (that's left for the more expensive iWatch.). We're going on a cruise so we'll see how the unit works during a river cruise.  Battery life is as advertised, about 10 hours before recharging. Spousal unit loves it. Will do an update in about 3 months.  I think that inclusion of the pdf copy is appreciated. The ity-bity instruction for ancient eyes is a plus. Thanks."
1332,Carlos Estremera,"I bought this for my daughter and this is her personal review: ""While this is no apple watch, it functions for my basic and most utilized applications. My favorite part is the battery life!!! This thing lasts me 12-14 days between charges. Works with Iphone notifications except for text messages...or I just haven't figured that out. Another app I love on it is that it tracks my cycle and it's spot on!!! Luxury smart watch without the price!"""
1333,Beth Moore,Attractive teal modern and versatile watch with many functions.
1334,RC,At first I loved my watch. After a month or so it has stopped tracking sleep and heart rate. Its not just a fancy pedometer.
1335,Pixie,"I absolutely love it, it does exactly what I need it to do and the battery life is fantastic"
1336,Jaclyn,It is great for the price for a basic fitness watch. I used fitbit too but it is just as good as the fitbit. Size is great for women as well and tracking well along with the app with great accuracy.
1337,C. Baker,This FitPolo smart watch/personal health tracker has exceeded my expectations. It was simple to set up to sync data onto my phone with an easy to follow app. Not only does it function as a watch but also a stop watch and timer. It also checks my heart rate and counts my steps throughout the day. It also has a relaxing function that instructs my inhales/exhales. The quality is amazing. You can’t beat the price either. Very satisfied customer. Recommended. 
1338,Marshall Clayton,"The hand strap material is skin-friendly, the operation is simple and not complex, the function is powerful, the Bluetooth automatic pairing, the screen is clear, the response is sensitive, the time is accurate, the dial is fashionable and has the texture."
1339,katie merritt,"I have had to watch for about two weeks and so far I like it. Battery life is excellent. I received the watch on Nov 28th and started using it right out of the box. Today is Dec 13th and I still have 25 percent battery life. I don't really care about tracking my menstrual cycle so I can't speak for that. The sleep function I don't really care for either but it is interesting to see patterns. (I apparently always get up to pee at 3a.) The mobile app is very easy to use as well. I do notice a ~50 calorie margin or error between the cardio machines and the watch. I do not know which is more accurate but it's still a good baseline for tracking. I'm sure the steps is not 100 percent accurate but again, base line. Overall, liking it so far!"
1340,Alainn,"Edited 7/16/2022: Does not monitor sleep activity. Disappointing. If you don’t care about sleep activity, it’s fine. Monitors heart rate accurately.  I really love this watch. I wasn’t sure if I would use it so I didn’t want to invest in a Fitbit. Very happy with the way this watch performs. Occasionally it will stop tracking my sleep. If I open up the app and go to the device menu, I choose more, then reboot my device. I don’t lose any information and it tracks my sleep again."

1349,KAREN CHACON,"I opened my box, I found the instruction manual in several languages, I connected my Smart Watch to the light and then I activated the Bluetooth of my cell phone, its connection was practically magical.  Now, it counts my steps, it allows me to see Wathsapp and Facebook messages and from my cell phone I can configure which exercises I practice.  It has everything I was looking for.     "
1350,Bonita Green,I love it
1351,Kem,
1352,Ali Aljundi,I like this watch very much. It was very easy to install the app on my smart phone and to pair the watch with it and then I started downloading my weekly activities on it. This helps me a lot to watch my progress on sports and how many calories I burn every day. The screen is big and could be read easily. It is also very fast to charge and it stays for days before I recharge it again. 
1353,RCook,Love it! Cost effective and utilize it more then the Apple Watch I used to own!
1354,John,Good
1355,Alec/ Carissa,"Battery life almost 10 days with daily use. Lasts many weeks if you don’t wear it every day. I’ve used it swimming a ton and no problems. Sports modes super fun. Sleep tracker great. App super easy to use and I love how I can view my runs and info all on the watch, even. Too many good things to say. Just buy it and you’ll see for yourself. "
1356,Amazon Customer,I’ve been using about a month now. Long battery life- app works perfectly with it. Love how it monitors my deep sleep & light sleep. ( which seems very accurate based on when I’m feeling wakeful). Great value for the money!
1357,Donna,"I did tons of research and comparison shopping on Amazon to decide which watch to replace my broken one. I thought I could change the face on this one when I ordered it but you can't. And it doesn't say you can...I have a small wrist so was afraid it would be too large but it isn't. It is on the last notch on the band. I love the band since it is so mush softer than my old one. I love the larger screen and the SMS messages is much easier to read and seems to be much more consistent than my old one. It has way too many sports to track than I need or want but that is ok. I finally figured out how to get the Walk to show. The Sleep tracker is much like all of the sleep trackers on every watch I have had or know about. It is way off! But that isn't why I purchased this specific watch. I like the way it charges over the ones that you have to take the band off to charge. That is a big plus because that is what wears out most of those...is taking the band off and on. It is easy to read the time. The battery percentage shows all the time, the day of the month and the day of the week show at all times. All good things to be aware of. I charge it once a week and that seems to work out great. All in all I am pleased with this fitness watch and the price was what I wanted. I would recommend this watch to my friends and when my husband's quit... I will order another one.  UPDATE: i was so pleased when I started playing around more and found some settings on the watch itself and I could actually change the wallpaper. I liked the deer face the best so will use that one for awhile. This is by far the best fitness watch I have had and this is my 3rd. The Message and Call alerts never fail. And it is easy to delete read messages, etc. I will order this fitness watch for my husband when his goes kapoot!  UPDATE #2: I am still super happy with this watch. It is so much better at receiving messages than my old one. Still learning new things about it. Would definitely buy again!     "
1358,Maria Murillo,I loved the watch! Is very easy to link to the app and it has a lot of functions. U can track the exercise u do and ur sleep. I’m not sure if it’s waterproof but one day I forgot I had it on and got in the pool and it still works perfectly! It was great purchase for me
1359,Frank Zone,I like this with tracing my sleep hours
1360,Soledad Oliva,"Me encanta este tipo de relojes, se lo regale a mi madre y esta muy contenta con el, tiene un tamaño no es tan pequeño,, pero tampoco es muy grande. Es ideal con el suficiente tamaño las letras y la pantalla que ella puede verlo sin dificultad y usarlo. Helpful"
1361,Johanna Moya,"I brought this smart watch for my sister,, she really likes it. She loves the color and the design, is so fast pair with your phone you just need to download the veryfit app and everything is there, you can personalize your screen. The battery duration is like one week. All functions work well. It's light and it vibrates when you gets notifications about messages, calls, alarms."
1362,Gregory - Northeast USA,The instructions are a joke. Really guys? The heart rate monitor is way way off. When it actually works. I am returning this.
1363,Betza1954,Comfortable to wear and looks nice.
1364,aj,Love this watch! It definitely keeps me motivated to stay moving and it’s great for self monitoring activity. It’s also cool just to see what your body is doing throughout the day.
1365,Kimberly Aguirre,"Love that it tracks your sleep, and my favorite part is the music controller. I wish it allowed you to answer calls/respond to messages but you can only decline/ delete them. Still, it's a great product for the cost! "
1366,Faith,"This is a very easy to use and setup. It is durable and well made. It connects to your phone and tracked all steps, heartrate and more."
1367,M,"I used this smart watch to give it to my grandma as a gift! I set it up for her. We liked that is very easy to use. You just need to download the app “VeryFitPro” and it will do everything for you! The watch count her steps, sleep time and heart rate. It also gives get alerts if she hasn’t move in a long time. We set alarms to remind her things like her pills and she cam see income messages and calls as well. She’s very happy with it (also because it’s waterproof and she doesn’t have to take it off while watering her plants or washing dishes). I was nervous it will be difficult to use but not at all. Ps: we liked it to an iPhone"
1368,Tammi Cordell,Great for the money and lasts for a week without charging - depending on how many notifications you get
1369,Carol,I needed one that would count my steps primarily. I suffered a recent heart attack and as a part of a fitness change wanted to have something that would help me set goals. It worked perfectly. I love the clear digital screen. I haven't used the other functions yet so I can't say. The charger while seems a bit awkward to apply at first is great. I'm totally satisfied.
1370,Farooq Ahmad,This smart watch is pretty handy and works perfect for me and I use it everyday to track my daily routine.
1371,ds,"For the cost, it works great."
1372,Colton Green,This is a great smart watch for a great price it met all my expectations I highly recommend getting this watch for yourself
1373,John Leal Jr,Happy
1374,Trixy,This wristband is gray and it is already discolored. I do like app and also the watch and trackers work well. But I’m really disappointed the band is discolored and I’ve only worn this Watch for 2 weeks. Hopefully I can find a replacement band.

1381,George C. Knudsen Jr.,"Great watch, more than I excepted!"
1382,HCthatsme,I got this for my Dad for Father's Day & he's still trying to get use to it.... I thought I had purchased 1 that didn't require linking it to an app but unfortunately that wasn't the case. It's just because my Dad is in his 70's now & technology isn't really his thing. He doesn't have the patience to figure it out as I think his memory has begun to fail him so we shall see how it all works out 🙏🏼
1383,Sammie,"The watch does what is supposed to do. It is very basic and kid friendly. It can not be compared to an Apple watch or Fitbit, so if you are looking for all the bells and whistles this is not for you. It is not practical to expect this watch to have $200-400 technology. Set-up and the app was quick and easy. The accuracy is off slightly, but only a few steps. Heart rate pretty accurate. Sleep was within 5 minutes difference. I purchased three for my kids and keep track of how active they are daily. It has helped cut back on tv, computer, and gaming time because they want to hit their steps goal."

It’s great because it alerts you of calls and texts and tracks your steps. I would buy this way before I’d ever buy another Fitbit. One person found this helpful"
1391,Ela,Is good I like how works and is perfect to take the control of my day and my training because I use to run and go to the gym
1392,Book Bunny,Watch is great for my needs and battery lasts a long time.
1393,Ann,For several days I compared watch to phone. Watch was always thousands of steps off. I’ve always used my phone just didn’t want to carry something. I will return this.
1394,C,Battery life was great. Watch was lightweight and comfortable. It does not have any speakers so there is no way to answer the phone. Basically just a wrist alert system for your pocket. I returned the watch because I needed to leave my phone in the work truck at times and the watch wouldn’t allow me to answer the phone r send a text
1395,Kindle Customer,"Battery lasts forever it seems. Going on 8 days and I'm still at 64%. It is attractive, and I like that I can choose to keep the screen from turning on with motion. I talk with my hands."
1396,Matthew,"Been using this product for about a week, and I am not disappointed. The charge lasts about a week. Compared what my treadmill records on miles ran against the watch, and they are very close. The heart beat monitor works great. Had a little trouble getting the message (SNS) to function, but I believe that was due to me. Overall for the price, I think this is a great product."
1397,Maria V Sanchez,"This is perfect!! First you can’t beat the price, the watch is so so easy no navigate, no problems AT ALL when pairing it, and you know what’s the best part? Battery life .. I turn mine off every night and it has last me a whole week with every day use .. I love that it counts my steps and heart rate and once again is user friendly.. I don’t need anything fancy and probably you don’t either! Seriously with your IWatch .. how many apps do you actually use? And if it’s an actual emergency, don’t you grab the phone and make a call anyway? Get the watch! Very good price, useful, cute and easy to navigate. Get it!!!"
1398,A Aquino,Bought this for my teen son and after hours spent trying to connect to both his and my phone it did not work! The instructions absolutely suck and so does the fact that he can’t even use it as a simple watch because it needs to sync to phone to change time which is wrong 😑
1399,Ohnotagain,"Sadly this watch did not work out for me.  Pro ish: Most of the calories burned/miles walks are pretty accurate although if you do allot of hand movements ((beat saber/mopping/ or talking with your hands)) that accuracy is no longer Water resistant long battery life Easy interface/ bright and big display  Cons: DOES NOT ever!!! stay connected to the app so after a few days when you need to unload the data bank GOOD LUCK! Even trying different methods.. loggin in sooner or what have you never seemed to work.. ((for those of you mentioning the trouble shooting method.. yes it worked but would still loose connection and idk about you but i dont want to have to trouble shoot EVERY time i use the watch)) I just couldn't keep it connected long enough before it would happen again and just become a hassle that I didn't care to use  Not enough feature to show calories burns.. This watch may be nice if all you do is bike/treadmill and walk but if you do more than just that its not going to appease what you are wanting.  Sleep monitor does not work as intended. I would wake up in the middle of the night and be up for a bit and it would still indicate that I slept the entire time.  text messages and phone calls. Yes it worked for a week before it broke and never worked correctly again. It would stop acknowledging rings or would randomly start buzzing when no phone call was coming in and wouldn't stop til it was turned off.  Overall--If you are looking for a watch with a bright big screen that tells you the time of day, how far you have walked and when you are about to start your period with ungodly amazing batterylife. This could be something for you. For those of us wanting to truely have a calorie counter and fitness tracker... possibly not for you."
1400,Jules,"This watch is so affordable, stylish, accurate, and functional. I wear it biking outside, and it withstands the elements. Must buy! I will buy different wrist bands ASAP."
1401,Tim T,"It doesn't offer alot of fitness and health features but for those who want the basics and a little more, it does a very good job for the money."

The app is easy to use and connects well with other apps. No issues with battery life but I do charge it daily. I would buy again without hesitation.
1411,Bridgette Harbour,"Works great! Very lightweight and I was able to wear it around at water parks that we’ve gone to, that was my main reason for getting it; the battery life is awesome. I’ve had it on for over a week and I’m only at 36%. Very very happy with my purchase"
1412,MH,I appreciate the watch for the price point most definitely doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a apple watch but is perfect for the bare necessities. Would recommend!
1413,LUDI A RODRIGUEZ,"I bought this Smart watch for my boyfriend because I got one already!. It is very helpful for him doing work out. Also check calories, and steps before going to bed. Other thing, is we can see our sleep status each day (it is very helpful because he has issues sleeping). I loved this model because is casual, and It matches everything. The most important is he bravely charges the watch, just once every two weeks."
1414,Hikinggoat,"Got the watch this morning. I read carefully before I ordered it. I needed it for swimming. Watch advertising says good for swimming however when you open it up and read instructions it says DO NOT SWIM.. “splash ok.” Wow, deceptive advertising, I’m very annoyed. Sending it back. Aarrgghh"
1415,RG,It was what I was looking for and it works great. Battery life lasts all day. Works very well with my Android.

1420,Diane Miller,Happily surprised with the battery charge. I bought this to help me track my recovery from surgery. Great app with easy to use functions . Nice to also get text notifications especially when you're expecting a reply but can't be looking at your phone a) the time.
1421,candice burnett,It worked really well for the first few days. Now it doesn’t track all of my steps. Not sure why.
1422,Steph,"I bought this watch to use when I went on vacation to Cancun, and it was perfect. I was able to tell the time even when I was on the water and I didn't have to worry about getting the watch wet. The battery lasts forever and now that I use it for daily wear I only charge it like once a week or whenever I feel like it since I just leave it laying around and put it on when I want to wear it. Even if I pick it up and it has low battery, if I charge it for a few minutes before I leave the house it will last all day. 10/10 good for intense outdoor and daily use."
1423,Deb Kennedy,Use to monitor activity. Doesn't work with wifi
1424,Dahena,This watch is great for the price. I cant use my phone at work but with this watch i can view all my notifications even incoming calls
1425,andyAmazon Customer,Decent battery life
1426,Frank B.,"My wife purchased a FitBit Versa 2 for me and I had it almost one year to the date and it started having problems tracking my sleep. It got worse to the point I could not depend on it. Finally it essentially fell apart and I looked for a replacement. Figured for $39.00 I would give this watch a try.  SUGGESTION - BUY IT!!  It does not have all the 3rd party apps that Fitbit does but dollar for dollar it is a better performer than a Versa 2. Battery life is OUTSTANDING and typically lasts 5-6 days without needing charging. I also like the oversized numbers on the clock face which shows all the time. For any one who has issues with their sight this watch displays large, colorful digits. According to the manual it is also waterproof (suitable for shower or swimming pool).  Sorry Fitbit, this watch kicks your Versa 2!"
1427,jeza21,"I like this watch, the features are simple and easy to use. Connecting to the VeryFitPro app was quick and no glitches between the watch and app site. I think the only thing I would have like is more variety of watch faces and being able to change to military time. Otherwise, for the amount of money that I spent, I am very happy with the results."
1428,Amberjack915,"Definitely an upgrade over my old watch. Better battery life, more features, larger screen makes it easier to read."

1434,Dayana,"For a long time I wanted a smartwatch but I was not sure if I wanted to spend so much money on one, so I was looking for a while for one that met my expectations and that fit my budget. I think this watch has fulfilled my expectations and it has worked very well since I have it, it also has a very nice design. I recommend it! "
1435,Samuel Ballesteros,I bought it to my mom and she really loved it. She said it works perfectly and I’m so happy to hear it!
1436,Bobbie,I bought this because I had started walking and exercising more and I wanted to see how I could approve from week to week so I could keep track so far I am pleased with this. I haven't used all the features on the phone yet I give it a four because I thought they could have a little bit more detail on the descriptions of how to operate. I walked with this the other day and it did keep up with my steps how long I walked my heart rate like I said I didn't set up everything on the phone because I didn't need everything I didn't need to set my calls up which you can do to notify you if a call comes in but I wasn't concerned with that I meant it was concerned about keeping track of my steps and heart rate and heartbeat.  but you can do a lot more with this phone so kudos to it. Eventually I will attach this to my phone for notifications that come in what I really like about this is the big square dial that was a plus for me because I hate squinting to see something and it's very bright so I'm very nearsighted so yes it works for me it's a good fitness watch and also the mobile app gives you all the statistics for the week and everything so it's a great great buy so far.

1437,Wendi L.,This is the second one I have purchased. I absolutely love it and wear it everyday.
1438,Meg Martin,Love this for the price.
1439,Beth Carter,"This is a good value for the price. I bought it to replace my Fitbit. I wanted it mostly for the watch, step counter & to monitor my sleep. I am pleased with those functions. The charge lasts for days. One person found this helpful"
1440,Birth & Body Works,Not what I thought but it was worth the cost of it. Just wasn’t what I was looking for.
1441,sarah,"I got this just for counting steps and it works great! I messed with some of the other features but they weren’t that great and they weren’t important to me. The step counter seems to be very accurate. It looks much more expensive then it is and it’s very durable. I’ve been wearing it nonstop except to sleep and shower and it still looks new. The battery lasts about a week, so I just charge it on the weekends or before I go out of town. It doesn’t have a way to track weight training, but it includes walking, running, yoga, cycling, etc. The app was easy to set up, but I do have to sync it every night to get it to save my steps. Overall very pleased with this purchase. 14 people found this helpful"
1442,Theresa Foster,Birthday gift for friend. Unable to rate product
1443,Myrian,What at great Smart Watch . Tracker and heart rate and let you know you are getting a call or text. Amazing! Have use it for a week and I still have battery life of 63% left. Love the big time numbers and date.
1444,Laura Gómez Lozada,"I got this fitness tracker as an early birthday gift for myself and I can say is completely amazing. I have never use a fitness tracker but since one of my bday goals was to start exercising this has been an amazing purchase in order to get to that goal. I love how it tracks your activities, heart beat, calories and besides all that you can check your social media, see who is calling, get text messages. It is amazing and for the price I would recommend this product a 100% "
1445,RenéeinTheUSA,This was a nice little inexpensive watch but after about a year the Bluetooth no longer functioned at all and apparently it isn’t waterproof - once my pool opened for swimming it all sort of crapped out after about 1 year. No regrets but it didn’t last very long.  One person found this helpful
1446,tweetzlady,I love this watch. It's really easy to use and works consistently. The price was great and it was exactly what I was looking for. I don't think I could have found something I'd like better. This isn't a paid review.
1447,Dinah Collins,I thought the product was going to be waterproof. The instructions say keep it dry. Big disappointment as I bought it to wear in the pool.
1448,The Dude,"Color: PINKVerified Purchase My daughter (pre-teen) requested this and loves it. Does absolutely everything it says it'll do. She has it connected to an Android (Samsung) smartphone without any issues. She's hard on equipment, and this watch has lasted over a month without being scratched or crushed. That's pretty good for technology in her hands. No face protection for the watch either. 4 people found this helpful"
1449,Igor Sivov,Bought for 9 year old. He likes it.
1450,M. O.,This is a great smart watch! I love that it tracks my fitness and the ability to get notifications and messages on my watch is so convenient. I also love the color!
1451,GRAMMA Lin,So it said charge before getting used It’s been 10 hrs and not charged yet Either that or function Bitton is messed up App was not easy to find or and load Very vague instructions Then finally get it going and it stopped charging after 27 days what a peice of crap 😠
1452,ms woo,The battery life is not bad. I can leave the watch off the charger for 3 days (turned off) And I will still have enough battery life for 3 days. I don't use it for sleeping. The mobile app doesn't take up too much space on my phone. One person found this helpful
1453,Eva,"Only had the watch for a few days before it had damage internally to the sensor mechanism. Maybe just a fluke incident, but not something I was happy about."
1454,Amy C.,Bought this for 6th grader going into middle school. We only have to charge it every 10 days or so. Great battery life. She only uses watch function and pedometer so it’s great for her
1455,M. Johnson,"Nice looking watch without the expense. Battery life is fantastic, I noticed it didn't track my sleep as well as I had hoped but this watch is perfect for beginners who are just leaning about digital watches. The app itself was easy to use & I recommend this watch to anyone. One person found this helpful"
1456,Elizabeth Martin,"Reviews for this watch all looked great. However, the first watch I received would not turn on after charging. Figured it was a fluke so I ordered a replacement. The second watch also did not turn on even after charging. I have owned a handful of smart watches— so it was not user error. Ultimately, I returned both watches and purchased a different one entirely."
1457,Roberta B.,I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She said it was easy to figure out how to use and was very happy with it.
1458,Dana Schirtzinger,"This smartwatch has provided me a great value for the cost since I purchased it in 2020. My reason for writing this review now is to commend the Fitpolo company for responding to questions that I had about this smartwatch and the VeryFitPro app that it used for collecting and displaying the health data. I did not receive a response from the contacts of the VeryFitPro or VeryFit apps regarding the syncing of data, and the status of the original websites used when registering products with those 2 apps. Only Fitpolo replied and provided me with helpful info. I plan to purchase a later version smartwatch by Fitpolo which also monitors for REM phases of sleep. Thank you Fitpolo!"
1459,Sleepyone,This item works great the only problem is it misses a night of sleep tracking every once in a while
